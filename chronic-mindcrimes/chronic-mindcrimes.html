            <strong>Pink Twilight Theory</strong>

            I haven't even started, but I wouldn't be surprised if you already thought there was something wrong with me. I'm just floating here--Lucy in a sky of cubic zirconium. I love Lucy. I love the word "zirconium". I think there's something honest about it, as a message informing you how the world works. I won't confirm or deny whether or not there's something wrong with me, but I will tell you that I'm honest in a similar way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's honesty regards a theory called "pink twilight," which is just a pretty way of describing the way things have to get ugly. According to philosopher Simone Rollkragen, any and all digital domains are doomed from the moment they cease to be commercially viable.

            Think the quick collapse of Minitel Pink [Ma Bell --> analog digital machine gun control], or [example]'s dense decline into degradation. In the beginning, and the end, is a Wild West of sorts. Nobody's safe when things turn left.

            And it ALWAYS turns left.

            Unless you pull the kill switch, as many companies often do. In a scramble to preserve profit or evade lawsuits, they take the coward's way out, aborting the internet's natural program, substituting [pre-established] protocols of precarity for problematic pretense. In other words, Pink twilight is just the course of history uninterrupted, the thing that happens when you don't kill an ineluctably pinkening thing.<br />

            And the truth is here and who I am. And the truth is, you've been looking for me. Looking for [some person/an entity] who can actually admit there's probably something wrong with him. Maybe, despite the violence they tend to entail, we like pink twilights because they're more honest than anything else we come across these days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So as the sun sets further down into epic nighttime ephemeral oblivion, and the moonlight triggers a cool and calming melatonin, don't forget that you've been looking for me. And when we say goodnight, a single tear creeping past our closed eyelids, penetrating any [pretenses] that we're not preparing to go to war with the next day, see if in your dreams you can find me. Lord knows I can't find myself...

            At the heart of physics is a fundamental uncertainty-absurdity, masked by an illusion telling us there's some kind of kettle calling black a pot of gold if you can just make it, make it to the end of the horizon. If God exists they are a master manipulator, which is to say magician, making something out of nothing, a cell, a flower, a me, a you, and a we [all] out of nonsense. Donning a sly invisible coat and an overtuned grin, skin oily for aesthetic shimmer and functionally slippery in case of the need for a great and fashionable escape (hocus pocus, open sesame), they, in all their opaque omnipotence, exhort us, "I know I work in mysterious ways, [Mr. Frost/videogame character/sports figure], but all you have to do is walk a little further down the road you chose, and I promise you'll get to the point of it all"

            Maybe black holes are what we should be praying to these days, worshipping on weekends and hailing as creator. Maybe black holes are simply waiting for our worship to reveal themselves. Maybe the hole is the whole point of holiness. Maybe black holes are portraits of a future we can't see. Maybe they're just lonely maybe God's in every one of them.

            Dear God, dear [reader/void/oblivion], if you're in there I would like to politely ask you to please stop hiding. If I spoke into the void that I miss you and want to see you again, would you appear out of thin air and say "there there" and make my heart ache less? Would you do anything to fill this void that is somehow both destroying and defining me, help me find the needle in a universe-sized haystack so we can string it all back together together? I beg of you. I beg of you! Don't just sit there and let me unravel! Don't tell me there's just a void in there. Don't avoid me. Don't void me. Don't say there's nothing left, or that there's nothing left to say. I won't believe you because I believe in you, just like how you've always wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear God Reader, if you sent me a message through your phone I would call it a holey text, and maybe even revere it as such. Reader God, if you feel like nothing or like a void right now I understand and I love you anyways. Even if you are nothing, I'll keep on walking down the road because you told me there's a point and you clearly want me to find it, and also cuz I think the point is you. And Reader I will keep on walking, just like how you asked. And Reader if you feel like nothing, I will make something out of you.

            Panacea
        </p>

        <p>
            Imagine an acme hole where the moon used to be. No natural light to guide you through to the morning. Just a permanent eclipse in your memory, lovingly haunting every time you look up to receive a slightly clearer picture of the sky. Does that future scare you? Does it besiege you with grief or loneliness? Would you find it just plain unbearable not to have something to stare at out your window while you sulk in the bathtub or cry yourself to sleep at night? If so, you and Alexander Abian could never be friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that's something you might not care about, but I think we should at least hear him out. Plots might thicken into a savvy kind of gravy if we center it around a protagonist you can't help but feel skeptical of. Abian, a marvelous yet ultimately miscellaneous mathematician, is our hero here because he has a dream to save the world. In that dream, there are no natural disasters, no wobbling Earth, no heatwaves or snowstorms or hurricanes. It's a good dream, I think, maybe even a beautiful one insofar as it facilitates smoother travel, more effective humanitarian aid and less volatile economic exchange. Climates are more stable, forcing strangers to figure out something other than the weather to discuss. Perhaps most charming of all, the Earth itself rebrands its angle, shifting from 29 to 45 degress off its axis.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            We love our hero, albeit relunctantly, so we will say this is a good dream, a beautiful dream. Now open your eyes. It's 3am in winter Buffalo, -17 Farenheit. A blizzard has snowed you in and you're running out of groceries. You're hungry and you grimace at the necessity of rationing your goods, which become less and less good with every repeated consumption. Less and less and less. Again and again and again. You're sick of the rerun you live in. You're angry that it's what you're stuck with because the next season got canceled. It's a bitter pitter patter of a boldly banal existence. And, somehow, the worst part is that you have to see it, that, every day, you have to look up at the ceiling instead of dreaming in the dark. You turn your head to the left, and, just for a splitting hair of a silver second, you could swear you see the moon laughing at you. And it keeps on laughing. And the more it laughs the more it hurts.
        </p>

        <p>
            And it hurts us too, because we love you, dear Abian, and we know you've worked so hard so much so grittily. It takes a herculean push to migrate from Iran to the states, to become an expert and authoritative voice in a field like mathematics. You've worked so hard, just to be stuck in a freezing house in Buffalo, or a state university in Iowa. Your passions have only led you to an absurd and absolutely boring [say this more like a fancy fashion lady, like Merilyn Streep in Devil Wears Prada] [time loop]. Abian, this life you know is your Sysyphean soliloquy. We know you tried, we know you're tired. We struggle with you along your long ladder leading nowhere, an inveigling invariance. We know the agony of the fact that the ladder is just barely less painful than falling off.
        </p>

        <p>
            But you don't see us -- heroes never notice their audience watching them on screen. All you see is your prison and the moon on your left, your belligerently bright warden. You long for something warmer, something safer, or at the very damn least something new. And so I will make one last stand to break out of this prison, by neutralizing its cold and calculating commander. If I have no more food to eat, I will become a lunatic lapping up the loveliness of loss. If I live in a rerun, I will get rid of all the seasons. If my colleagues are right when they say destroying the moon will create a hail of falling debris, then it will be a better way to go. If the moon is the only one here to keep me company, I would rather be alone. Who needs the light at night, anyways?
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the moonless Earth Theory and I must say it resonates with me on the level of a pang. I think the sun might feel relief without the burden of a moon to love, or to bicker with at dawn and dusk. Perhaps all tragedy is selenetropic. Perhaps all loving and losing is lesson best unlearned.
