rules:

- no big files in the repo plz -- we'll host them elsewhere

- fun ascii stuff can be found here: [ascii generator](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/)

PATRICK'S TODO LIST/PATRICK-ADJACENT PLANS:
- (by oct 5th) add an event listener to the htc interface with a throttle so that weâ€™re not checking like ALL the time, but so that we can fade out the controls when the mouse is still and bring it back when the mouse moves
- (by oct 5th) HTC component - Want to fix true random next button so that it cycles thru all of them before recycling. Could try and fix this by (instead of having them on separate URLs) making it one page where the video source changes, to allow us for keeping memory
- (by May) design and implement a wiki-first UX for the site - team thing
- find replacement photos for Project Tulpa site - team thing
