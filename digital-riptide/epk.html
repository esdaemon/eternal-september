    <h1>DIGITAL RIPTIDE MEMORY PALACE</h1>
    <div class="lyrics">
      <p>DIGITAL RIPTIDE MEMORY PALACE centers around a live recording of a show that never happened.</p>
      <p>In the world of Eternal September, Digital Riptide was a promising '80's no wave band from New York City.</p>
      <p>Digital Riptide featured dueling saxophones, multiple vintage synths, fretless bass, and electronic drums.</p>
      <p>Their song Pink Twilight was released as a single, along with a video featuring a Lite Brite face mask.</p>
      <p>This is an excerpt of that video:</p>

    <div class="lyrics">
      <p>The band was fronted by two singers: Liera and Gordon Voidwell. They were in love. Then it all fell apart.</p>
      <p>Their last show took place at The Pyramid Club in NYC at the height of Digital Riptide's musical powers.</p>
      <p>The set they played that night in 1986 mirrored the rise and fall of Leira and Gordon's own relationship.</p>
      <p>The show was reviewed by the Village Voice. Posters were printed for the show. Band t-shirts were sold.</p>
      <p>This is the show's set list:</p>

    <div class="lyrics">
      <p>"Live at the Pyramid", recorded via the venue's soundboard, includes the sound of audience interaction.</p>
      <p>A limited run of cassettes were printed by White Columns, the band's label. They were put into storage.</p>
      <p>Digital Riptide was interviewed by a fan with a camcorder following the show in the Pyramid's greenroom.</p>
      <p>After the break-up, Gordon Voidwell went solo, releasing experimental disco music with synths and strings.</p>
      <p>Liera formed a band called Metal Swans featuring three saxophones, fretless bass, and electronic drums.</p>
      <p>Metal Swans debuted on the public access show Phantom Access TV two years after Digital Riptide's demise.</p>
      <p>This is an excerpt of the audio from that performance:</p>

    <div class="lyrics">
      <p>The remaining members of Digital Riptide went on to form the power electronics trio Black Screen of Death.</p>
      <p>Black Screen of Death paired their brutal noise with experimental film footage from the 1960's and '70's.</p>
      <p>This is a still from one of those films:</p>

      <p>The Memory Palace presents all these elements - music, video, objects, photos - as an installation.</p>
      <p>At the center of this installation is the 1986 recording itself: Digital Riptide's "Live at the Pyramid".</p>
      <p>At the center of that album is the song "Into the Turquoise" - a reference to a black hole's event horizon.</p>
      <p>At the center of that song is an infinite emptiness surrounded by waves of nostalgia in all directions.</p>
      <p>This is an excerpt from that song:</p>
