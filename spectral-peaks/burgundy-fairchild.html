        What is having your hood on inside meant to communicate,<br />
        <span class="one">Sebastian?</span><br />
        <span class="pointfive">Even the word “chopper” can mean so many different things.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are glowing triangles hovering ‘round the entrance to your room<br />
        <span class="pointfive">leveling judgement upon all who enter.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        Sebastian<br />
        <span class="pointfive">try to understand</span>
      </p>
      <p class="one">
        Sebastian<br />
        <span class="pointfive">try try try to understand.</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are skiing brochures in wicker basket in the downstairs bathroom,<br />
        <span class="pointfive">and skiing is spelt so strangely.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        But what other choice do we have? It’s not something you<br />
        <span class="pointfive">can just go rogue with.</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="pointfive">
        Sebastian, do you hear
        <em><span data-wiki="the-moldau">The Moldau</span></em><br />
        <span class="pointfive">in every bumbling brook?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        Do you always prefer the B-side<br />
        <span class="pointfive">as a matter of principle?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I do. And to the extent that I am you<br />
        <span class="pointfive">and you are me, we are scrambled eggs.</span>
      </p>
      <p>The world is scrambled eggs.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="pointfive">
        We are standing by the window, Sebastian,<br />
        looking out over the silent parking lot. And<br />
        it is the way I see the world:
      </p>
      <p class="one">
        <em>as if through glass</em>
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        Because the music in the lobby by the<br />
        window seems to be saying that nothing<br />
        ever happens.
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        But this parking lot used to be a swamp<br />
        and before that there were Pterodactyls
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">And before that . . . <em>Hot Goo</em>.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They still teach Pluto in school, and Pluto<br />
        <span class="pointfive">is wrong. (Try not to extrapolate)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist</span> in me thinks there’s
        something<br />
        after this, Sebastian, but the hotel music says<br />
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">Promise me you won’t believe it.</p>
      <br />
      <p class="one">Promise, <em>promise me</em> you won’t believe it.</p>
