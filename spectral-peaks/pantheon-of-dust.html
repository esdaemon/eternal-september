        FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW BASIS OF DE-CONCEPTUALIZED REALITY
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        All that is named is concept, everything I see, hear, touch, taste, and
        smell. Even the ethereal, spaceless thoughts on my brainscreen. The
        process of de-conceptualizing my reality is a tri-integration of therapy,
        meds, and good shows on TV. Evolution takes effort and is fueled by
        distress. Especially that final thrust, the crossing of the threshold,
        when names become, again, only names, when the divided becomes whole, when
        I’m swallowed up into what is constantly manifest. It is then and only
        then that my bicameral mind will finally be fully assimilated.

        Upon Saturn’s orbital interaction with Jupiter, the lunar object Mercury
        was ejected, passing closely by our planet and, via the entanglement of
        magnetospheres, causing a mass and immediate cerebral snow crash amongst
        Earth’s people. An event so catastrophic that it was placed by humanity
        into the oubliette of collective amnesia.

        In 2015 German doctors documented a case of dissociative identity disorder
        in which the patient’s eyes were conditionally blinded by the brain while
        inhabiting a damaged “alter”, a staunch and definitive refutation of both
        physicalism and prestidigitation.
