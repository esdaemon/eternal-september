        FRAMEWORK FOR A NEW BASIS OF DE-CONCEPTUALIZED REALITY
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        All that is named is concept, everything I see, hear, touch, taste, and
        smell. Even the ethereal, spaceless thoughts on my brainscreen. The
        process of de-conceptualizing my reality is a tri-integration of therapy,
        meds, and good shows on TV. Evolution takes effort and is fueled by
        distress. Especially that final thrust, the crossing of the threshold,
        when names become, again, only names, when the divided becomes whole, when
        I‚Äôm swallowed up into what is constantly manifest. It is then and only
        then that my bicameral mind will finally be fully assimilated.

        Nebuchadnezzar fulfilled the prophecy of
        the god Marduk, the text of which was found in the House of the 
          Exorcist. After
        exacting revenge on the Elamites, he presided over Marduk‚Äôs rise to the
        head of the Babylonian pantheon which paralleled the gradual mental
        de-lateralization of his people.

        Upon Saturn‚Äôs<strong><a href="" class="Œ©">Œ©</a></strong> orbital interaction with Jupiter, the lunar object Mercury
        was ejected, passing closely by our planet and, via the entanglement of
        magnetospheres, causing a mass and immediate cerebral snow crash amongst
        Earth‚Äôs people. An event so catastrophic that it was placed by humanity
        into the oubliette of collective amnesia.
