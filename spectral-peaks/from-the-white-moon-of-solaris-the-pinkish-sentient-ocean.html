        <strong>From the White Moon of <span data-wiki="solaris">Solaris,</span> the
          Pinkish Sentient Ocean</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I've said this before<br />
        I apologize profusely<br />
        but I am not of this world.<br />
        Words come up on my brain screen<br />
        asking me to buy things<br />
        but I know not what they mean.<br />
        I am surrounded by seagulls.<br />
        Soft white bread erupts from<br />
        the pockets of my chinos.<br />
        I keep the true name of God<br />
        in a locket 'round my neck.<br />
        It is never to be opened,<br />
        he said.
        <em>"Boy, it is never to be<br />
          opened."</em>
      </p>
      <p class="pointfive">
        I am not an astral projection. And,<br />
        if when you talk to me you hear arctic<br />
        radar beeping, it is only me wrestling<br />
        with words I cannot understand. I can<br />
        however frame your deficiencies as gifts:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="one">
        <em>"I love the way you walk sideways on the beach<br />
          <span class="pointfive">so as not to scare the birds"</span></em>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="pointfive">
        And I recognize that I am not always<br />
        there for you, even in my strange way.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        That I am in love with you is<br />
        impractical knowledge. It manifests<br />
        itself only in movies about movies<br />
        on my brain screen. I insert subtle,<br />
        knowing references to your favorite<br />
        flower (Anemone) and your<br />
        first pet (Patches). Films you couldn't<br />
        possibly by their very nature see,<br />
        films I can't even tell you about<br />
        without tarnishing their altruism. And<br />
        what is love if not altruistic.
      </p>
      <p class="onepointfive">
        <em>"If told of the truth, there would<br />
          be no truth left within them."</em>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="one">
        So I am left to express my love through<br />
        not sighing too loudly when getting up<br />
        or sitting down lest you think it anger.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And I don't know what the
        <span data-wiki="ornithomancy">white birds</span> mean<br />
        when they linger outside our window. They<br />
        aren't watching us as much as being watched,<br />
        telling us something nameless and subtle.<br />
        And I turn to you to speak, but what comes<br />
        out sounds like a buzzing fridge<sup>1</sup>. You smile<br />
        at me with warm woman cheeks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="onepointfive">
        <em>We are on the pink sentient ocean, the whole<br />
          world is my id, save maybe for the birds,<br />
          who retain their original purpose: to be<br />
          at one with the sky on overcast days<br />
          making muted sounds the clouds think<br />
          they surely must have imagined.</em>
