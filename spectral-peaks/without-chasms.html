          <sup>1</sup>Episode 3:16:
          <em><span data-wiki="apocrypha">Apocrypha</span></em>, the first fully mythological edition of the show - its
          plot
          only
          fully understandable in reference to previous and subsequent episodes.
          It is worth noting the name of primary guest star John Neville and the
          coincidental parallel thus formed with <em>John 3:16</em>, the biblical
          verse most often quoted as the essence of Christian belief.
