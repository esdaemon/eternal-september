    <strong>Without Chasms</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am digging my own Suez canal<br />
    like a lobster in a fog bank
  </p>
  <p>
    I am wearing earplugs under earmuffs<br />
    like a man who's had enough
  </p>
  <p>
    I am sometimes mean to animals but<br />
    don't call the fun police

    There is always something under construction<br />
    someone is always building something
  </p>
  <p>
    The machines they use are loud<br />
    they breathe through shattered glass
  </p>
  <p>
    The men working are short of but not completely<br />
    lacking in fresh drinking water

      <sup>1</sup>Episode 3:16:
      <!-- links to self -->
      <em><span data-wiki="error">Apocrypha</span></em>, the first fully mythological edition of the show - its plot
      only
      fully understandable in reference to previous and subsequent episodes.
      It is worth noting the name of primary guest star John Neville and the
      coincidental parallel thus formed with <em>John 3:16</em>, the biblical
      verse most often quoted as the essence of Christian belief.
