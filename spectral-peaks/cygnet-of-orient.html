  <p>Life is a <span data-wiki="error">covariant</span> ritual</p>
  <p class="one">which is to say</p>
  <p>
    <span class="pointfive">things are always changing</span><br />
    but the mechanism is immutable
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>Fear of lawns is my dojo</p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <span class="pointfive">when the mercury is high</span><br />
    I bask in the heat of my hidden fundament
  </p>
  <p class="one">which is to say</p>

    <em><span class="pointfive">The dark pond offers up its turquoise,</span><br />
      a cygnet molts upon its periphery

    I once said to her: <span data-wiki="hair-metal">hair metal</span> is the
    new avant-garde
    <br />
    <span class="pointfive">and what I meant was -</span>

    <span class="pointfive">“I will wait by the campus fountain</span><br />
    with dusky comportment of a cave youth”
  </p>
  <p class="two">
    (also said but not said:
    <em>I miss when “arcade” didn't mean

  <br />
  <p>
    The concept of true multiplicity is forever strange -<br />
    <span class="pointfive">our language of opposites is duplicitous</span>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I will build myself a mirrored world, and live in it<br />
    <span class="pointfive">and only the cygnet will know where to find me.</span>
