    <strong>Beautiful Dreamer</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Where are you
    <span data-wiki="steven-bochco">Steven Bochco</span>? <br>
    Your show was on after a show I liked<br>
    lending a spectral glow of impermanence.<br>
    I crave a new theme song, something so blue<br>
    as to be never-ending.
  </p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <em> With the car windows down in the summer <br>
      I can feel the soft expanse of time <br>
      spread out before me like in <span data-wiki="tron">Tron</span>.</em>
  </p>
  <p>They say marry your best friend and I think <br>
    I have done that Steven Bochco. <br>
    When I wake in the morning I sometimes <br>
    open in her eyes and see myself sleeping, <br>
    still like an animal corpse.</p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <em> There are palm trees in my mind <br>
      and palm trees in the mall <br>
      and I'm not sure there is a difference.</em>
  </p>
  <p>We have a beautiful child,<br>
    film and television director Steven Bochco.<br>
    When he smiles waves of warm light<br>
    turn me into a dove and the crystal dust of morning<br>
    spreads itself evenly out over all things<br>
    so as to be practically invisible. But it is there<br>
    Steven Bochco, of that you can be certain.</p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <em>PAUSE</em>
  </p>
  <p class="one">There is a pain in my cerebral cortex I can't escape,<br>
    presenting itself as fact without nuance or specificity.<br>
    I am trying to give birth to it, stretching my mouth,<br>
    breaking my teeth. I thrust my skull back like a<br>
    pez dispenser and vomit
    <span>meconium</span>. All this happens
    <br>
    too Steven Bochco, star of stage and screen, the world<br>
    is not all porcelain birds on glass bookshelves. But of<br>
    course you know this.
  </p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <em>
      The streets of <span data-wiki="los-angeles">LA</span> are
      sometimes quiet<br>
      when they should not be and I sit<br>
      and I wait for it to come.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span data-wiki="cicadas">Cicadas</span> burrow underground for seventeen years<br>
    so why don't we kill them while they are sucking on roots<br>
    before their pulsating genitals cut through the earth?<br>
    A concept we could perhaps extrapolate onto all things<br>
    Steven Bochco, millionaire?
  </p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <em> Should I focus instead on the place rain begins,,<br>
      and the color in between each color in the,<br>
      <!-- links to self -->
      <span data-wiki="error">photon</em>span> mist sunset?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Someday I will die Steven Bochco, and I will see<br>
    everything all at once. And in that moment,<br>
    I will realize that only time has kept me from things.<br>
    And I will touch my child's face like a ghost and<br>
    he will feel a cold breath and wonder<br>
    what comes after this.</p>
  <p class="pointfive">
    <em> The canyons spread out before me,<br>
      hurricane weather is coming.<br>
      And afterwards, stars.</em>
  </p>
  <p>And I will tell him, Steven Bochco.<br>
    And I will tell him all I know now<br>
    to be true.</p>
