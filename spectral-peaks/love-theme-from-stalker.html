  <p class="pointfive">
    <span class="minusfive">I see ghosts in every rosebud</span><br />
    in every mature theme<br />

    <em> What happens is fair to everyone else but me</em>

  <p>It’s coming into focus like a new piece of spearmint:</p>
  <p class="twopointfive">“Baby, it's high time for a downer”</p>

  <br />
  <p class="onepointfive">
    In the glowing ash of Chernobyl<sup>1</sup><br />
    they found a male praying mantis, blue.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="two">Hard as cement</span><br />
    <span class="three">and headless.</span>

  <p class="one">
    <span class="minusfive">The soviet train keeps coming, rambling</span><br />
    through the night. Populated by ghost<br />
    spheres of non-meaning. Like a sepia<br />
    lens of sound.

    <span class="minusfive">By now the '80’s have been pillaged. All my soft pink</span><br />
    memories, stated so plainly in the construction<br />
    house. I keep going back there and the words<br />
    keep changing.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p class="twopointfive">
    <em>She married a military man. I feel<br />
      certain that he drinks.</em>
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    And like the childbeast in
    <em><span data-wiki="eraserhead">Eraserhead</span></em>,<br />
    I engage in hysterics. Remember me,<br />
    <span data-wiki="eraserhead">Philadelphia</span>, when your corners are clean.

    Remember me (see: Henry Purcell<strong><a href="" class="Ω">Ω</a></strong>),
