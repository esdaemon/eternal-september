    <h2>Dido's Lament Revisited</h2>
    <p>
      I. <br><br>
      <em>
        When I am laid in earth<br>
        no trouble in thy breast<br>
        remember me
    </em></p>
    <p>
      II. <br><br>
      I married a military man 
      <br><br>
      And I am certain<br>
      <span class="pointfive">of the wicked well he drinks</span>
      <br><br>
      Of all the things that I could not've known<br>
      <span class="pointfive">it is this love most unsuspected</span>
      <br><br>
      And now into it's mirrored depths I fall<br>
        <span class="pointfive">escape is singed by sunlight burned</span ><br>
        <span class="pointfive">and banished from my mind</span >
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      III. <br><br>
      Your hand Belinda for darkness shades me<br>
      <span class="pointfive">on your shoulder let me rest</span>
      <br><br>
      More I would but death invades me<br>
      <span class="pointfive">the darker part of darkness waits</span>
      <br><br>
      All my memories they have been pillaged<br>
      <span class="pointfive">with your arms steady my gate</span>
      <br><br>
      To the cliffs I return to drown his visage<br>
      <span class="pointfive">within darkness there is darker</span><br>
      <span class="pointfive">darkness waiting still</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. <br><br>
      I see you in every rose bud<br>
      I see you in every cerulean swell<br>
      I hear you in every wanderer's song<br>
      I feel you in each and every battered breath
      <br><br>
      <em>
        Remember me<br>
        when I am laid<br>
        in earth
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      V. <br><br>
      Outside these walls the ships keep coming<br>
      <span class="pointfive">filled with the ghosts of my dead wishes</span>
      <br><br>
      And like a child beast of Hades<br>
      <span class="pointfive">I am lost in these hysterics</span>
      <br><br>
      Remember me my sailor when your darkness comes<br>
      <span class="pointfive">aside the river Lethe I shall be waiting</span>
      <br><br>
      Remember me dear Belinda<br>
      <span class="pointfive">now walk me to the door.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. <br><br>
      Welcome dear sailor to Hades<br>
      <span class="pointfive">it is here I have been waiting</span>
      <br><br>
      Like a photograph, like a silent storm,<br>
      <span class="pointfive">like a dried up rose.</span>
      <br><br>
      This night my pain<br>
      <span class="pointfive">shall not be wasted!</span>
      <br><br>
      The time has come<br>
      <span class="pointfive">my violent heart is chastened</span><br>
      <span class="pointfive">undress, it is our reckoning.</span>
