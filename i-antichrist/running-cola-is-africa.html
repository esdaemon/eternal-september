    <em>Almost all of it is gone now…</em><br>
    I want to leave this mall. The space I occupy has been drawn down to a single point.<br>
    The interior of the McCafé is confusingly bi-level and decorated like an ad for "Alpine Christmas".<br>
    <em>I can sit with this feeling, but it never . . . it never . . . </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    These streets are littered with pamphlets on <span data-wiki="error">palimpsest</span>.<br>
    <em>Palimpsest ad nauseam. </em><br>
    There's a chance I lose my mind in this world.<br>
    My desires, my history under constant reevaluation.<br>
    <em><span data-wiki="codicil">Codicil</span> is not a word I take lightly.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Pontiac forms and reforms - a RAM-rendered blip jet.<br>
    Subtle mutations upon each manifestation.<br>
    <em><span data-wiki="running-cola">Running Cola is Africa</span>.</em><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    <img src="./i-antichrist-images/running-cola.png"
      alt="The sparsely-outlined silhouette of a runner in full motion smoothly transforms, from left to right, into a Cola bottle, and the continent of Africa."

  <p>
    One thing becomes another and then another.<br>
    It's the way natural selection works.<br>
    But somehow, the opposite.<br>
    <em>The transmogrification of metal into dust.</em>
  </p>

  <p class="pointfive">
    If the problem could be clearly articulated,<br>
    the solution could perhaps be gotten at.<br>
    But the problem appears to be endemic.<br>
    <em>Baked in.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    It's not a glitch in the system.<br>
    More something to do with being <em>alive</em>.<br>
    With seeing the skies part, and the light come down. <br>
    A laser not on a single plane but everywhere at once.<br>
    Breaking the upswirling bird tornado into <span class="vt323">bitz</span>.<br>
    <em>Incinerating them, really.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Like us, they fly up into space when they need an "out". <br>
    Like there's somewhere else.<br>
    Somewhere other than where they find themselves to be.
