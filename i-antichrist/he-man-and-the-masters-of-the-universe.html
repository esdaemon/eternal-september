    Built above a cold void that could be considered crystalline were it not<br>
    entirely bereft of material substance. In my youth, I called it boredom<br>
    and smoked it like curved 100's. Deep within its depth: <span data-wiki="archangel-michael">archangels</span> and a<br>
    gradual dawning as to the role they may play in my craving of bong hits.

  <p class="pointfive">
    A power not <em>in</em> the spacelessness but <em>resulting from it</em>. A force needed<br>
    to jettison the knowledge of its presence at each and every moment, to<br>
    morph and mythologize its guts into some kind of phantasmal pall.<br>
    The murky sound of dub. A wainscoting of dust and cerebral thunder.
