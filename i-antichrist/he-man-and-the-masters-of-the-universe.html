        Built above a cold void that could be considered crystalline were it not<br>
        entirely bereft of material substance. In my youth, I called it boredom<br>
        and smoked it like curved 100's. Deep within its depth: archangels
        and
        a<br>
        gradual dawning as to the role they may play in my craving of bong hits.

        A power not <em>in</em> the spacelessness but <em>resulting from it</em>. A force needed<br>
        to jettison the knowledge of its presence at each and every moment, to<br>
        morph and mythologize its guts into some kind of phantasmal pall.<br>
        The murky sound of dub. A wainscoting of dust and cerebral thunder.

        Gautama called it paradise, we can (and do) cut it up with a knife. The<br>
        gloaming deathknell of static reality. The <!--video rip-->

          <em>Three Men and a Baby</em>. Ockham's razor as applied to hidden anguish.<br>
        Panic you are a vixen. It's beyond the power of my fiction to contain you.
