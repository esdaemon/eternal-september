<p class="PoemTitle one"><strong>Metal Swans in Rain</strong></p>
<p>
  It feels good to grow a beard <br>
  when things turn apocalyptic
</p>

<p class="onepointfive">
  <em>
    I’ve heard tales of a synthesizer<br>
    that sounds of <a href="../digital-riptide/metal-swans">metal swans in rain</a>
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  I am looking for someone to take my will<br>
  I am looking for a way to get fucked<br>
  <span class="pointfive">and to stay fucked</span>
</p>

<p class="onepointfive">
  <em>
    the rocks appear as <span data-wiki="ornithomancy">flamingoes</span><br>
    come to adjudicate our reckoning
  </em>
</p>

<p class="pointfive">
  For someone to whisper softly “aesthetics”<br>
  <span class="pointfive"> with my head bound and cupped<br></span>
  <span class="pointfive">with my head cupped and bound</span>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I am constantly reminded that I need<br>
  <span class="pointfive">a handler. (That you in fact may<br></span>
  <span class="pointfive"> read this).</span>
</p>

<p class="onepointfive">
  <em>
    I sometimes wish I could remove my mind<br>
    <span class="pointfive">and fuck it with your mind, penetrate it</span>
  </em>

<p class="one">[Your sunglasses are inside you.]</p>

<!-- links to "demiurge" -->
<p>Q: What does it mean that I want to call you “<span data-wiki="error">demiurge</span >”?</p>

<p class="onepointfive">
  [A kind of fucked that eradicates<br>
  <span class="pointfive">all guilt and triviality]</span>

  <em>
    Mine eyes water<br>
    <span class="pointfive">obfuscating the hills</span>

</p>

<p class="one">And to think we once used margarine.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s hard to talk about... but still let’s talk</p>

<p class="pointfive">
  from this bridge above the highway<br>
  where everyone is leaving town
</p>

<p class="onepointfive"><em>Birds lie silent on the marjoram landing</em></p>

<p>
  Let’s talk about getting fucked, staying fucked<br>
  <span class="pointfive">and what we will later do to find food.</span>
