  <strong>Phage [related: Silurian Theory]</strong> <br />
  Robotic looking self-replicating virus composed of protein encapsulated DNA.
  Phage have been used experimentally by Soviet scientists to preserve food and
  virophage. There are thought to be around 10<sup>31</sup> phages on earth -
  more than every other lifeform combined. It is estimated that over 75% of all
  marine bacteria is infected by phages. The metallic, mechanistic appearance
  and highly advanced/efficient self-replication methods of phages has led to
  speculation that they in fact constitute nanotechnology of either ancient or
  alien origin â€” an idea supported by the Silurian Hypothesis<sup>1</sup>.

    physicist Adam Frank postulating the existence of an advanced reptilian
    species<sup>2</sup> pre-dating the age of the dinosaurs. Taking its name
    from the <em>Dr. Who </em>television series, the Silurian Hypothesis points
    out that certain extant seemingly biological systems may in fact be remnant
