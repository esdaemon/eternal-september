  <strong><em>Transformers </em><a href="" class="Ω">Ω</a> [Sep. 17 1984 - Nov. 11
    1987][related: Megatron, Creation Matrix, Unicron]</strong>
  <br />
  Long format television show based on toy line by Japanese manufacturer Takara.
  The show focused on a dystopian alternate reality populated by shape shifting
  robots in which humans are incapable of any kind of meaningful interpersonal
  contact, perhaps due to Social Panic and/or a mass reversion to a
  <span data-wiki="bicameralism">bicameral</span> mindstate. At the time of its
  initial release, <em>Transformers</em> was subject to widespread derision due
  in part to the unreality presented by Megatron's (the metallic lead villain)
  ability to drastically shrink the material volume of his form by up to 800% in
  order to be deployed as a handgun by fellow Decepticons Starscream or
  Soundwave while battling the Autobots. It was also initially unclear if either
  the Autobots or Decepticons were capable of procreation as they collectively
  appeared to be of one neutral gender. Upon the <span data-wiki="error">death of Optimus Prime</span> né Orion Pax<sup>1</sup>, the 5 million-year-old leader 
  of the Autobots, it was revealed that the lifeforce and religious beliefs of the 
  Autobots centered around the Creation Matrix - a crystal orb housed in Optimus 
  Prime's chest containing within it the digital imprint of all deceased Autobots. 
  Via this vast, almost limitless storage of information, the Matrix is able to impart
  sentient life force into newly designed machines. In this way, the Matrix is
  positioned as the antithesis of the Unicron, a swirling "infinite void"
  hellbent on dismantling the multiverse through "Unicron
  Phenomenon<sup>2</sup>" — a viral process estimated to have consumed
  approximately 84% of the multiverse<sup>3,4</sup>. The intoxicating metaphysical
  substratum of Transformers lore was significantly undercut by the poorly
  received (even by children) crossover Devil's Due comic book series in which
