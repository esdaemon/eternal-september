  <strong>Parallax</strong> <br />
  Greek for alternation, often used to denote subscreen systems in video games
  used to enhance the feeling of depth and movement (a division of fore-,
  middle-, and back-ground graphic fields scrolling at different rates), thus
  contributing to <span data-wiki="ehspf">EHSPF</span> functionality. A prime
  example being the

  <span data-wiki="error">Training Scene in <em>Mike Tyson's Punch Out</em></span><sup>1</sup>, a 1987 <span
    data-wiki="nes">NES</span> title. Parallax also
  applies to the derivation of various stellar distances via techniques like
  triangulation and the measurement of

  <span data-wiki="doppler">Doppler</span> redshift. Results from these
  measurements are given in units called parsecs, where <em>d</em>=1/<em>p </em>when the parallax is given in
  arcseconds. However, this approach has proven
  insufficient when applied to Venus'

  <span data-wiki="black-drop">black drop</span> effect. Astrophysicists have
  speculated this shortcoming is due to the infamous "parallax" error, a
  mathematical glitch requiring an equational addendum [see below] to compensate
  for what is essentially a rounding error when dealing with distances of
  stellar magnitude.

    <sup>1</sup>A title later re-skinned as Punch-Out!!! Featuring Mr. Dream. It
    was widely and errantly reported the re-skinning was due to Tyson's 1992
    conviction of raping Miss Black Rhode Island in an Indianapolis hotel room -
    however Nintendo cancelled Tyson's contract immediately following his
    stunning upset to Buster Douglas under the Tokyo Dome in 1990.
