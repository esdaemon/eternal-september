  <strong>Roger Bacon [related: Brazen Head] [1219-1292]</strong> <br />
  Widely considered the father of the modern scientific method, a powerful wizard, and the inventor of submarines. Bacon
  wrote groundbreaking treaties on both optics - studying the function of light and its interaction with the eye - and
  linguistics, arguing that reality itself is held within language<sup>1,2</sup>. To this end, he supported a
  re-evaluation of the
  Septugiant and often came into conflict with the

  <span data-wiki="error">St. Augustine</span>, resulting in his
  imprisonment later in life. The Philospher's Stone is also attributed to Bacon. Skilled at both alchemy and
  necromancy, Bacon became known for the creation of a Brazen Head with which he could communicate with the dead. He has
  been hypothesized as an owner (and even author) of the <span data-wiki="voynich-manuscript">Voynich Manuscript</span>.
