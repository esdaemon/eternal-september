  <strong>Joybubbles [May 25, 1949 - August 8, 2007, related: Church of the Eternal
    Childhood]</strong>
  <br />
  Born Josef Carl Engressia in 1949, Joybubbles was the father of phone
  <span data-wiki="phreaking">phreaking</span> and an ordained minister in the
  Church of Eternal Childhood<sup>1</sup>. He was born blind and boasted an IQ
  of over 172. Joybubbles became nominally famous at the age of 7 after
  discovering and exploiting the frequency of AT&T's "<span data-wiki="phreaking">trigger tone</span>", establishing him
  as the world's first phreaker. As a young adult,
  Joybubbles successfully monetized his formidable phreaking technique via the
  sale and dissemination of hand printed long distance calling cards, leading to
  a period of surveillance and prosecution by the FBI at the behest of

  social security and payments for his role as test subject in experimental
  medical trials. Citing numerous instances of child sexual abuse, Joybubbles
  officially and permenantly reverted to the age of 5 in May 1988, remaining
  there until his death. In his will it was stipulated that he continue to be
  listed, in perpetuity<sup>1</sup>, as "Joybubbles, I Am" in any Ma Bell owned
  and operated telephone directory.
