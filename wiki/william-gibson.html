  <strong>William Gibson [January 20, 1969-][related: <em>Neuromancer</em>, <em>Agrippa</em>, <em>Burning Chrome</em>,
    ICE]</strong> <br />
  World renowned experimental speculative fiction writer and poet, Gibson coined the term "cyberspace" in his 1982 short
  story <em>

    <span data-wiki="error">Burning Chrome</span>
  </em>. He was itinerant as a child, moving throughout the south
  with his family, and came into
  adulthood a self-avowed draft dodger and frequent user of psychedelic drugs and <span
    data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span>, eventually settling in
  Toronto as accepting a job in the city's first "head shop" after a prolonged period of homelessness. Following the
  birth of his first child in 1976, Gibson enrolled at the University of British Columbia in order to gain access to
  public assistance and began studying writing. His first short story, "Fragments of a Hologram
  <span data-wiki="rose-pattern">Rose</span>", was published by
  <em>Unearth 3</em>. <em>Neuromancer</em>, his first novel initially baffled critics, but went on to sell over 6.5
  million copies<sup>1</sup>
  worldwide. Despite the novel's abstract setting and obscure vocabulary, <em>Neuromancer</em>'s cult success spawned a
  handful
  of attempts at dramatization, most notably <em><span data-wiki="wintermute">wintermute</span></em>, an experimental
  television show created and directed by <span data-wiki="steven-bochco">
    Steven
    Bochco
  </span> that debuted (and was subsequently cancelled) in 1986. Gibson's portrayal of cyberspace as a "widespread,
  interconnected digital technology" presaged the actualization of the Internet by roughly 20 years, and much of the
  technology featured in his dystopic visions either exists or is currently in development<sup>2</sup> - a clairvoyance
  attributed
  by many to his sustained and structured psychedelic use. An avid and skilled cryptographer, Gibson often collaborated
  with the nascent <span data-wiki="phreaking">phreaking</span>/hacking community as evidenced by the 1992 release of
  <em>Agrippa (book of the dead)</em>, a
  300-line pseudo-biographical poem centering on the ethereal and illusory nature of memory. <em>Agrippa</em> was
  published on a
  3.5" floppy disc designed to self-destruct upon first viewing embedded in a book of etchings by the artist Dennis
  Ashbaugh which was subsequently treated with chemicals to fade when exposed to light. The disc's code (known commonly
  as the <em>Agrippa</em> code) has never been successfully parsed. <span data-wiki="mindvox">MindVox</span> reportedly
  leaked the contents of Gibson's poem
  within its BBS system. The manner in which MindVox gained access to <em>Agrippa</em> remains a matter of great
  speculation -
  its posting was attributed only to "Templar", an entity of unknown identity. Reportedly, the contents of
  <em>Agrippa</em>
  outlines what Gibson dubbed "the mechanism" and its role in memory and the perception of reality. Most commonly, "the
  mechanism" is interpreted as technology when employed in effort to document (and artificially freeze) time. This
  process of artificial documentation serves to create a false sense of discrete "self" disconnected from contiguous
  reality, anchoring memory in the "past" despite the fact that the past is a mental construct that can only be accessed
  via "the <em>Now</em>". <em>Agrippa</em> has factored in heavily to other areas of cryptographical activity since its
  creation
  including
  repeated appearances in <span data-wiki="error">Cicada 3301</span>'s materials.

  <p><sup>1</sup>The novel also served as the central point of inspiration for <span data-wiki="error">Lord
      Blankenship</span>'s GURPS Cyberpunk
    toolkit, leading Gibson to be briefly surveilled by the United States federal government despite being a Canadian
    citizen at the time.</p>
  <p><sup>2</sup>Gibson's use of the term ICE as an acronym for Intrusion Countermeasures
    Electronics beginning in his
    short story <em><span data-wiki="error">Burning Chrome</span></em> has become common parlance for various forms of
    firewalls and anti-virus software,
    including BlackICE, created by the

    <span data-wiki="error">Silicon Valley</span> start-up Network ICE and acquired by
    <!-- links to self -->
    <span data-wiki="error">IBM</span> in 1999 for $78 million
    dollars. In Gibson's oeuvre, Black ICE refers to protective virtual reality systems capable of murdering intruders
    (both digital avatar and pilot).
