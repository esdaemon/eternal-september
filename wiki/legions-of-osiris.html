  <strong>Legions of Osiris [related: Pixote Rambo][disambiguation: <span data-wiki="error">Legion of
      Doom</span>]</strong>
  <br />
  Followers of the Egyptian God of the Dead. Osiris was reportedly dismembered by his evil brother Set into <span
    data-wiki="error">23</span> pieces - chards of flesh later recovered by his wife Isis (aside from the phallus). The
  term Legion of Osiris also became associated with the followers of New York City street poet and cult leader Pixote
  Rambo, whose cryptic tags lined the naked black billboards of the BQE and the <span data-wiki="gowanus-canal">Gowanus
    canal</span> throughout the early '00's. Pixote Rambo referred often to the "Light Bearers", drawing association
  with <span data-wiki="luciferin">Luciferianism</span> and <span data-wiki="error">Oculism</span> - as well as <span
    data-wiki="light-singing">Enochian Light Singing</span>. They also repeatedly represented G-d as a fully red or
  black triangle and often featured triangular or pyramidion symbology. Pixote Rambo's text art was largely
  characterized by short edicts espoused in ancient Grecian font and mangled Latin orthography (ex. "chvoas (sp) leads
  our orders, orders lead our chvaos" and "angvels (sp) are skreams") treated by their followers as scripture. In
  addition to their visual work, Pixote Rambo was active as an MC in the late 1990's, at one point collaborating with
  the legendary underground hip-hop artist <span data-wiki="rammellzee">RAMM:ΣLL:ZΣΣ</span>.
