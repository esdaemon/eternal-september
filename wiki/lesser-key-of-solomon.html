  <strong><em>The Lesser Key of Solomon</em> [aka
    <em>The Grimoire of Solomon </em>aka <em>The Legemeton]</em></strong>
  <br />
  An anonymous and essentially pseudo-biographical book on demonology commonly
  attributed to the biblical figure
  <span data-wiki="lesser-key-of-solomon">Solomon</span> commonly known as
  <em>The Legemeton</em>. It appears to have been compiled in the 17th Century,
  with much of the text bearing stark resemblance to Johann Weyer's
  <em>Psuedomonarchia Daemonum. </em>Structurally, <em>The Legemeton</em> is
  divided into five books,
  <em>Ars Goetia, Ars Theurgia-Goetia<sup>1</sup>, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel,</em>
  and <em>Ars Notoria</em>. Notably, the <em>Ars Goetia</em> contains a
  comprehensive list of all 72 demons and their various rankings. In 1904 a
  version of <em>The Legemeton</em> titled
  <em>The Book of Goetia of Solomon the King</em> edited by Samuel Lidell
  MacGregor Mathers was published by

  evocations in the <span data-wiki="enochian">Enochian</span> language and a
  series of essays portraying the described rituals as means of introspective
  exploration (aka focused meditation) as opposed to summoning.
