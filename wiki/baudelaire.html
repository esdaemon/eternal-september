  <strong>Charles Pierre Baudelaire [April 9, 1821 - August 31, 1867]</strong> <br />
  French poet, essayist, and art critic. Coined the term <em>modernity</em> in reference to the transient nature of
  rapidly
  industrializing Paris - a reality he felt was the responsibility of the artist to accurately and unabashedly
  represent. Due to excessive use of <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span> he became wrapt in the throes of

      Have pity, my one true lust nostalgic <br>
      Down to a dark abyss my heart has sounded, <br>
      A dystopian world by grey horizons bounded, <br>
      Where blaspheme horror swims a lake <span data-wiki="cimmerian">cimmerian</span>.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      A frigid sun floats overhead one six months,<br>
      the other six darkness wraps the metropolis;<br>
      a terrain more bleak than the polar wastes<br>
      Neither beasts, nor streams, nor verdure, nor woods.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      But no horror in the world can surpass in dread <br>
      By the cold razor of this glacial sun<br>
      And that huge night like primal chaos spread<br>

      I envy the most putrid beast somnambulant <br>
      heart slowed near death in cave or coral gable, <br>
      So slowly an arc of these dark years do trace.<br>
