  <strong>Code-X Digital<sup><strong><a href="../codex-digital/">Î©</a></strong></sup></strong> 
  <br />
  Early web logging (or blogging) platform launched by <span data-wiki="mindvox">Phantom Access Technologies</span>, parent company of <span data-wiki="mindvox">MindVox</span>, in 1992. The platform enabled users to upload up to 30 individual blog entries, which were then auto-cataloged into a left panel "index pane" on the left side of the site. Users were given access to both an on-platform ASCII generator to create banner titles for their blogs and an image-ditherer - software which converted complex, scanned photos into 2-4 color dithered bit images. Users were given two template color choices - a primary fill color and a line color. Later versions of the platform also allowed up to 2-3 additional colors in individual blog entries. Typical of the era, auto-scrolling was not enabled - all scrolling was conducted via use of a scalable scroll bar pinned on the hard right of the site.

  Unlike the BBS communication systems contemporary to the time, Code-X Digital was designed specifically for longform, one-way communication. The platform's designers (reportedly including <span data-wiki="lord-digital">Lord Digital</span>) were reportedly inspired by the ancient tradition of creating compendiums of related knowledge, or <span data-wiki="codex">codices</span> (<span data-wiki="codex">codex</span> in singular). Some users (of which there were admittedly rather few) displayed an awareness of this neogolism, weaving references to various codices into their entries (ex. <span data-wiki="codex">Codex Gigas</span>, <span data-wiki="codex">Berlin Codex</span>, the <span data-wiki="voynich-manuscript">Voynich Manuscript</span>). The overall tone of content on the Code-X Digital platform skewed towards the obscure, the poetic, and the conspiratorial<sup>1</sup>. Despite the platform's lack of direct communication functionality, Code-X Digital's small pool of active users began, over time, to reference eachother's postings in subtle ways<sup>2</sup>. The platform fell into gradual disuse in the late 1990's, paralleling both the various legal and personal problems suffered by MindVox's founders and the (relative) popularity of PAT's subsequent platform release, <span data-wiki="phantom-archives">Phantom Archives</span>. However, smatterings of poetic hypertext from Code-X Digital's users exerted an influence on a number of artists outside of the platform, including the experimental No Wave ensemble <span data-wiki="esd">Electric Snow Dream</span> and the notorious performance art collective <span data-wiki="error">Shepherds of Apocrypha</span>.

    <sup>1</sup>Though unsupported by any really metrics, the platform was thought to be used mainly by single (often but not exclusively male) individuals who were active users of <span data-wiki="error">cannabis</span>. <br />
    <sup>2</sup>As an example, "X" became a stand-in term for a former romantic partner or otherwise unobtainable object of desire.
