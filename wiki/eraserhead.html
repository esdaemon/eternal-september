  <strong><em>Eraserhead</em> [related: Philadelphia]</strong>
  <br />
  A 1977 film by American filmmaker, artist, musician, and actor David Kieth
  Lynch [Jan. 20, 1946 - ] set in dystopian mid-'70's Philadelphia. A work
  fueled by a deep sense of anti-nostalgia and a refutation of traditional
  procreation-based American values with Lynch's first child depicted as a
  deformed and endlessly needy creature. Funded largely by the actress Sissy
  Spacek and filmed on location at Greystone Mansion, a set of derelict stables
  in which Lynch also lived, the film.
