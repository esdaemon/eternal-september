  <strong>Incubus</strong> <br />

  Popular emo-alternative<sup>1</sup> rock band who's fame plummeted in the mid-1990's after it was revealed they
  participated in
  ritualized "circle jerk" sessions. The band's name was taken from the Late Latin term for a male demon who has sexual
  intercourse with sleeping or otherwise incapacited women - the female counterpart to a succubus. The prevalence of
  incubus-oriented mythology throughout various ancient civilizations is commonly attributed to sleep paralysis or
  somnambulism, though modern scholars have posited that the myth may have arisen largely as a way for rapist holymen to
  avoid prosecution.
