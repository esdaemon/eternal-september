  <strong>Octagon of Dex</strong> <br />
  Mildy experimental rock group active throughout the 1980's. Known primarily for scoring a number of promising but
  ill-fated television series, many in collaboration with the writer/director/producer <span
    data-wiki="steven-bochco">Steven
    Bochco</span>. The group's only
  commercial release was self-titled, and included their most successful single, also called Octagon of Dex - a song
  originally composed for the <em><span data-wiki="neuromancer">Neuromancer</span></em> spin-off show <em><span
      data-wiki="wintermute">wintermute</span></em>. The group's connection to Gibson's novel preceded
  their work on the series - their name is an appropriation of <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span>'s
  term for
  a pill of amphetamine<sup>1</sup>. Infighting
  within the group often led to controversial musical choices, particularly in reference to the frequency, length, and
  instrument choice of non-vocal solos<sup>2</sup>. Although the group never established a mainstream commercial presence, its
  credit and montage scoring on shows like <em><span data-wiki="skynet-syndrome">SKYNET SYNDROME</span></em>, <em><span data-wiki="otherworld">Otherworld</span>
  </em>, <em><span data-wiki="jan-michael-vincent">Airwolf</span>
  </em>, and <em>
    <!-- goes to content in octagon of dex contag -->
    <span data-wiki="error">My Nepenthe</span>
  </em> are notable for their
  compositional depth and [attempts at] high-level musicianship. The group disbanded following repeated attempts to
  score the opening of an aborted <em>

  </em> American reboot.
