  <strong>Archangel Michael AKA Saint Michael the Taxiarch</strong> 
  <br />
  First mentioned in the <span data-wiki="enochian">Book of Enoch</span>, Michael is portrayed as the lead archangel in the scriptures of <span data-wiki="error">Christianity</span>, Judaism, Islam, and Baha'i. In the biblical <em><span data-wiki="error">Book of Revelations</span></em>, Michael battles <span data-wiki="luciferin">Lucifer</span>, essentially to a draw. In the Talmud, Michael plays an essential role in freeing Jerusalem from <span data-wiki="error">Nebuchadnezzar II</span> under <span data-wiki="error">Babylonian</span> captivity. However, various <span data-wiki="apocrypha">apocryphal</span> <span data-wiki="error">Gnostic</span> texts speak of Michael's eventual demonic possession, including the <em>Apochryphon of John</em> found in the <span data-wiki="codex">Nag Hammadi Codex</span>. In it, Michael is placed under the control of Yaldaboath the <span data-wiki="error">Demiurge</span> and is represented by the lion in the <span data-wiki="ophite-diagrams">Ophite Diagrams</span>. Constrastingly, <span data-wiki="error">Seventh Day Adventists</span> believe the Archangel Michael to be Christ himself.
