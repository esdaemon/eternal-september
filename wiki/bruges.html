  <strong>Bruges [related: Belfry of Bruges]</strong>
  <br />
  Largest city of the Flemish region of Belgium. Spared from destruction in both
  World War I and World War II. As a result, has one of the highest densities of
  historically significant architecture in the world, perhaps most notably the
  Belfry of Bruges which houses a municipal carillon of 47 bells on an upper
  octagonal stage, employing a full-time carillonneur.
