  <strong>Hair Metal</strong>
  <br />
  Sub-genre of popular music that reached peak visibility in the mid/late 1980's
  characterized with <span data-wiki="luciferin">Satanist </span>undertones, subversive
  androgenie, and a fascination with German culture as evidenced by the (often
  grammatically incorrect) diacritic use of the "metal umlaut"<sup>1</sup>.
  Prominent acts include <span data-wiki="hysteria">Def Leppard</span>, Whitesnake,
  Cinderella, and Mötley Crüe. Categorization of Hair Metal acts is decidedly
  non-binary, with notable groups embracing certain tenets and rejecting others
  (see: <span data-wiki="operation-mindcrime">Queensrÿche</span>, W.A.S.P. (We Are Satan's People), AC/DC
  (After Christ/Death Conquerors), and Blue Öyster Cult<sup>2</sup>. Prior to its rapid decline in the early 1990's, hair metal featured prominently in popular culture discourse and was thought by the Christian Family Research Council to be morally destructive and exhibit qualities of subliminal mind control<sup>3</sup>.

      Guitarist Donald "Buck <span data-wiki="dharma">Dharma</span>" Roeser stated that the band's
      use of the metal umlaut was meant to reference the Wagnerian aspects of
      Metal.
