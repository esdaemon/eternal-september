  <strong>HealthGoth AKA Health Goth</strong>
  <br />
  A lifestyle trend indigenous to the early naughts combining aspects of both
  extreme fitness and goth subcultures. Characterized by the employment of all
  black (but highly breathable) exercise clothing and a collective penchant
  towards candlelit soul cycle classes.
