  <strong>The Voynich Manuscript [related: Glossolalia]</strong> <br />
  A codex of text and imagery of unknown origin and language. The Voynich
  Manuscript has been studied extensively by professional cryptographers since
  it's purchase in 1912 by a Polish-Samogitian book dealer. It is written on
  calfskin dating from around 1400 AD and contains over 170,000 unique
  characters with no punctuation. These characters appear to follow some kind of
  phonological regulation aka grammatical system - with certain characters
  functioning as vowels and others never appearing side by side. According to
  experts, the text does not appear to be enciphered due to the fluidity of its
  ductus or lettering. Overall the manuscript appears to be divided into a
  series of different subjects - an analysis of plant-like organisms and their
  pharmacological uses (though none seem to directly correlate to known existing
  species), a set of startlingly accurate astrological charts decorated with
  naked women, a set of obscure circular cosmological diagrams containing
  depictions of castles, volcanos, and more naked women, and a dense extended
  section of compressed text including imagery consisting entirely of naked
  women wearing crowns in bathing pools connected by an elaborate system of
  pipes. There are also dragons. Amongst the many unverified hypothesis
  regarding the Vonyich Manuscript's provenance and purpose, the four most
  prevalent are as follows:

<ul class="wiki-ul">
  <li>
    It is an elaborate fabrication/hoax by a 17th Century bookseller upon having
    discovered unused calfskin from the 1400's.
  </li>

  <li>
    It is an extended and detailed documentation of glossolalia<sup>1</sup>.
  </li>

  <li>
    It is the work of the 13th Century polymath

  <p>
    <sup>1</sup>An oft misinterpreted term - glossolalia, though now associated
    almost exclusively with the "speaking in tongues" phenomenon characterized
    by the nonsensical grammar and animal-like noises by seemingly possessed
    "believers" on afternoon talk shows, was, in the Gnostic view, a channeling
    of "direct language" aka the "language of angels" and represented a return
    to non-conceptual/representational linguistics.
