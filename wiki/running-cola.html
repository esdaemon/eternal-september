  <strong><em>Running Cola is Africa </em>[related: Cybernetic Serendipity]
  </strong> <br />
  A groundbreaking set of algorithmically-generated lithographs dating from 1968. The prints were created by members of
  <span data-wiki="error">IBM</span> Tokyo's Computer Technique Group [CTG] and debuted as part of <em>Cybernetic
    Serendipity</em>, the world's first large scale exhibition of computer art held at London's Institute of
  Contemporary Arts [LICA]. Despite being viewed by over 64,000 attendees, the work failed to sell. It was later
  acquired by the LICA for Â£5 and has since been kept in climate controlled storage. <em>Running
    <!--link to cola wars--><span data-wiki="error">Cola</span> is Africa</em> is commonly considered to be the first
  piece of [aesthetically convincing] <span data-wiki="ai">A.I.</span> art - the full set of prints are now valued at
  approximately 3.8 million dollars.
