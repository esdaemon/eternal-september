  <strong>Venetian Pool</strong> <br />
  A public swimming pool located in <span data-wiki="coral-gables">Coral Gables</span>, a historic (by Floridian
  standards)
  city in Miami-Dade county. At
  820,000 gallons, it is the largest freshwater pool in the United States. The entirety of the Venetian is filled daily
  via artesian wells<sup>1</sup>. The pool is peppered with romantic nooks, including a disquietingly warm and poorly
  lit grotto
  that extends into the surrounding hillside - a veritable bastion for teenage make-outs.

  <p><sup>1</sup>At the behest of area environmentalists it was discovered in 1987 that the Venetian's daily draining
    process had
    significantly depleted the Floridian aquifers sourced for the neighboring area of Coconut Grove2.</p>
  <p><sup>2</sup>The site of the Mutiny Hotel3 and the largest drug bust in the history of the US (75 tons of sweet

      Bolivian white horse</span>).

  <p><sup>3</sup>The center of global cocaine trafficking throughout the 1980's and where OJ ate breakfast after
    escaping murder
    conviction with his look alike new girlfriend.</p>
