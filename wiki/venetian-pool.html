  <strong>Venetian Pool [see also/disambiguation: <span data-wiki="venusian-enigmata">Venusian Enigmata</span>]</strong> 
  <br />
  A public swimming pool located in <span data-wiki="coral-gables">Coral Gables</span>, a historic (by Floridian standards) city in Miami-Dade county. At 820,000 gallons, it is the largest freshwater pool in the United States. The entirety of the Venetian is filled daily via artesian wells<sup>1</sup>. The pool is peppered with romantic nooks, including a disquietingly warm and poorly lit grotto that extends into the surrounding hillside - a veritable bastion for teenage make-outs, especially on autumnal crepuscules.
