  <strong>Thomas Kinkade</strong> <br />
  Hyper-popular photorealistic painter and self-ascribed "painter of lightâ„¢<sup>1</sup>". It is estimated that, as of 1992, one-in-twenty U.S. households own a Kinkade. His work, flippantly discredited by uppity artworld intelligentsia as kitsch, follows in the Luminist<sup>2</sup> tradition and often features subliminal Christian imagery. A figure of great controversy, Kinkade was dogged throughout his career by claims that he "manufactured" his work using poorly paid underlings [see: Jeff Koons]. His paintings are among the most counterfeited in the world - he is among the best selling artists in Asia despite having no gallery representation on the continent. Kinkade passed away at the age of 54 from acute alcohol and <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotic</span> intoxication<sup>3</sup> while attending a Las Vegas<sup>4</sup> sales convention.
