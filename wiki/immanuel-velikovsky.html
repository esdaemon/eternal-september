  <strong>Immanuel Velikovsky [Jun 10, 1895 - Nov. 17, 1979, O.S. May 29, 1895 - Nov. 17, 1979] [related: Collective Amnesia, <em>Worlds in Collision</em>, Theory of Interplanetary Electro-Magnetism]</strong>
  <br />
  A Russian independent scholar whose book
  <em>Worlds in Collision</em> supports the concrete "Bible as Historical Document" theory
  when seen alongside the work of
  <span data-wiki="bicameralism">Julian Jaynes</span>.
  Velikovsky claimed, based on extensive and irrefutable historical and
  scientific data, that various ancient phenomena (ex. the parting of the Red Sea) were entirely literal
  occurrences resulting from poorly understood or erroneously dismissed events presented in various religious and <span data-wiki="apocrypha">apocryphal</span> texts<sup>1</sup>. To elucidate, around 1500 BC Venus<sup>2</sup> was ejected from the orbit of Jupiter, hurtling much like a comet through the solar system, colliding with Mars and sideswiping Earth, wreaking havoc on tides, weather patterns, and menstrual cycles. The close proximity of Venus' trajectory caused the Earth to switch both electro-magnetic polarity and rotational spin, leading to a swarm of strange and catastrophic phenomena as recounted in the Old Testament and <em><span data-wiki="enochian">The Book of Enoch</span></em>. He supported his claims by the development of the groundbreaking Theory of
  Interplanetary Electro-Magnetism which positioned gravity and orbital mechanics as being counteracted by electro-magnetism, a hypothesis discounted
  at the time by Newtonian physicists currently experiencing a resurgence in the
  extended <span data-wiki="error">quantum</span>/meta-physical community. Often mistakenly labelled as a
  Creationist [see:
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Christian Theology</span>],
  Velikovsky was an empirical scientist also active in the field of psychiatry,
  publishing in Sigmund Freud's <em><span data-wiki="imago">Imago</span></em> an
  insightful and revolutionary analysis of Freud's own <span data-wiki="error">cocaine</span>-fueled recurring dreams.
  Collective amnesia, a phenomenon coined by Velikovsky in effort to explain the
  lack of historical documentation of certain natural disasters and social
  crises (i.e. the <span data-wiki="tower-of-babel">Tower of Babel</span>) is
  now commonly accepted in the world of
  cyber-metaphysics. Velikovsky extensively studied <span data-wiki="error">King Solomon</span>, seeking to contextualize the king's efforts<sup>3</sup> to categorize and control alleged demons within the realm of science. Velikovsky claimed that the <span data-wiki="error">Shamir</span>, Solomon's mysterious tool for creating the First Temple, were not supernatural worms or barely, but a rapidly decaying radioactive mineral, most likely malachite. This hypothesis, though controversial, is supported by a number of historical facts:
</p>
<ul class="wiki-ul">
  <li>The glowing green color of the Shamir.</li>
  <li>The fact that the Shamir was kept in a leaden box wrapped tightly in wool.</li>
  <li>The adverse health effects of those operating the Shamir, including severe bowel and eye irritation.</li>
  <li>The eventual degradation of the Shamir's effectiveness (roughly corresponding to malachite's half-life).</li>
</ul>
