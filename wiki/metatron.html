  <strong>Metatron [related: Enoch, Book of Enoch][disambiguation: Megatron,
    Tefillin]</strong>
  <br />
  Ancestor of Noah and namesake of <span data-wiki="enochian">Enochian Magick</span>. As
  detailed in the <span data-wiki="septuagint">Septuagint</span>, Enoch was taken alive by
  God into Heaven after living for 365 years and transmuted into an Archangel
  capable of retaining corporeal form for use in direct human communication. His
  angelic form is referred to in various Gnostic and <span data-wiki="apocrypha">Apocryphal</span> texts as
  <span data-wiki="metatron">Metatron</span><sup>1</sup> - a term largely purged from
  biblical doctrine by the

  <span data-wiki="error">Church Fathers</span>. Significant lore
  originally associated with Metatron was subsequently and misleadingly
  attributed to the <span data-wiki="error">Archangel Michael</span>. Metatron's role as an intermediary
  between God and Man, however, remains central to Judeo-Christian mythology in
  various

  containing selected bits of prophetic and enigmatic scripture of apotropaic
  purpose - often relates to Metatron<sup>1</sup>, and his name is synonymous
  with "active intellect". Islam traditionally recognizes the active presence of
  Metatron, commonly referring to him as "angel of the veil". Forms of apocrypha
  are attributed to Metatron himself, often grouped together by scholars into
  the controversial Book of Enoch<sup>3</sup>, a series of visionary documents
  centering largely around eschatology and outlining the role of
  extraterrestrial Watchers and Giants in the creation of humanity - concepts
  later explored in Blumrich's
  <em><span data-wiki="spaceships-of-ezekiel">The Spaceships of Ezekiel</span></em>. The Epistle of Enoch, usually
  listed chronologically last in the Book of
  Enoch, outlines in detail the name and provenance of all fallen Archangels,
  including the origin and role of <span data-wiki="luciferin">Lucifer</span><sup>4</sup>. In various forms of
    <!-- links to self -->
    <span data-wiki="error">Gnostic</span> literature, Metatron is commonly
    seen as having achieved what might be called "full enlightenment" and gained
    access to a non-spatial non-temporal plane of existence. Thus, like the <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddha</span>, Metatron can be said to exist as an omnipresent though
    not omnipotent fulcrum point between

    <sup>1</sup>In fact, in certain literature, Metatron is also used to refer
    to the Tabernacle itself.

    <sup>2 </sup>Roughly "protectant" in Greek - in common day the term
    Phylactery is used interchangeably with Tefillin outside of the Jewish
    culture, but traditional covered a wider varied of wearable amulets and
    charms meant to ward off discarnate forms of evil.

    of God".
