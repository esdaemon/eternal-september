  <strong><em>Hadean Lands</em> [related: The Halting Problem]</strong> 
  <br />
  A Web 1.0 text-based system of interactive fiction. The platform received notoriety for its <span data-wiki="error">Occultist</span> undertones and startlingly sophisticated <span data-wiki="ai">A.I.</span> interface. Although the name directly references the <span data-wiki="hades">Greek Underworld</span>, the Hadean Lands narrative actually unfolds in "an alien, airless wasteland" comparable to a "vast chasm" or <!--link to bland axiom in IA-->"<span data-wiki="error">endless white space</span>". The program is notable in part for its creative employment of "the halting problem<sup>1</sup>" as a cybernetically embedded pitfall of raw code.
