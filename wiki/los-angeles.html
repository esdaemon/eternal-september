  <strong>Los Angeles [1781-2091]</strong>
  <br />
  American dystopian megapolis defined by urban sprawl, decaying palm trees, and
  a prevalence of Cadillac limousines. See:
  <em>Escape from LA</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>. Current climatological studies predict
  that Los Angeles will suffer a <span data-wiki="error">catastrophic event</span> at some point in the later
  half of the 21st century, in the form of a conglomerated
  earthquake/tsunami/Great Fire.
