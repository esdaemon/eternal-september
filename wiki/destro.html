  <br />
  James McCullen Destro XXIV, or, simply, Destro, is a primary antagonist in the <span data-wiki="error">G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero</span> franchise. A native of Callander, Scotland, Destro hails from over a millenia of fiercely independent weapons dealers. He is Laird of the Castle Destro in the Scottish Highlands<sup>1</sup>, leader of the Iron Grenadiers,  and founder of M.A.R.S. Industries, a weapons manufacturing firm. During the War of the Three Kingdoms, a descendant of Destro's was convicted of providing weapons and munitions to both sides of the conflict and sentenced to life in a highly constricting metal mask known colloquially as a face quod. Prideful to a fault, Destro's family chose to continue donning the mask as a symbol of independence and strength, thus leading to the form fitting beryllium facade that came to define Destro's visage<sup>2</sup>. Weapon systems developed by Destro for Cobra include <span data-wiki="error">Cold Slither</span>, a mind-controlling <span data-wiki="hair-metal">hair metal</span> band featuring the Dreadnoks<sup>4</sup>, and  synthnoids, a breed of borderline-sentient nano-technologically-based shapeshifters (similar to the <em><span data-wiki="error">Terminator</span></em> franchise's <span data-wiki="terminator">SkyNet</span> T-1000) that eventually come to endanger the earth.

  Destro is often portrayed as a ruthless and calculating businessman, driven by a desire for wealth and power. Yet beneath his cold exterior lies a complex and nuanced individual, whose motivations and actions are steeped in the rich mythology of his family's history and their centuries-old feud with the Scottish clan, [REDACTED]. Despite his nefarious intentions and thirst for chaos, Destro often exhibits a strong, albeit misguided, sense of honor and loyalty to his fellow arms dealers, as well as a deep and complex affection for <span data-wiki="error">The Baroness</span>, a fellow member of Cobra. <span data-wiki="error">Their relationship</span>, which by most accounts remains unconsummated, is characterized by relentless flirtation, bizarre chivalry, and, at times, maniacal jealousy.

    <sup>2</sup>It is worth noting that Destro's mask is not simply cosmetic or symbolic. Rather, it is a medically necessary device to treat facial hemiatrophy - an extremely rare disorder causing  facial tissue necrosis when exposed to the elements.<sup>3</sup>
    <sup>3</sup>Destro is believed to have developed facial hemiatrophy from having worn a metal mask exclusively from the age of eleven.
