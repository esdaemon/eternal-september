  <strong><em>11B-X-1371</em></strong> <br />
  A video cypher of unidentified origin received and published by the
  website GadgetZZ.com in 2015. The film centers on a figure dressed as a
  plague doctor holding an irregularly blinking light against the backdrop
  of pulsating buzzing resembling that of a <span data-wiki="cicadas">cicada</span> swarm.
  Cryptographic messages including threats of bioterrism, the phrase "red
  lips like tenth" (aka KILL THE PRESIDENT), and the geographical
  coordinates of the White House have been found hidden in the video.
  Further, the film's spectrogram itself generates an image displaying the
  phrase "you are already dead" amongst a strange reddish texture resembling
  wet earth or fresh blood followed by yellowish mutilated and tortured
  bodies. Despite subsequent numerous and questionable claims of authorship,
  the generation and intent of the video has never been confirmed, though
  many speculate a connection to the activities of both

  unauthorized attempt to promote the debut of <em>12 Monkeys</em>, a SyFy
  series based on the short film <em>La Jetee</em> by the mysterious french
  filmmaker <span data-wiki="chris-marker">Chris Marker</a>.
