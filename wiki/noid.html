  <strong>The Noid [related: Domino's Pizza]</strong> <br />
  Voiced by puppeteer Pons Maar<sup>1</sup>, the Noid was a fictional character
  designed to personify and thus dramatize Domino's Pizza's "Delivery in 30
  Minutes or Less" advertising initiative. Clad in a tight red rubber body suit
  extending over his long rabbit-esque ears, the Noid persistently yet
  ineffectively attempted to prevent the prompt delivery of pizza due to his
  stated abhorrence "of all things fresh". The Noid's popularity culminated in
  the development of <em>Yo! Noid, </em>a<em> </em>video game developed by the
  Japanese software

  <span data-wiki="konami">Capcom</span> for the
  <span data-wiki="nes">NES</span>. However, release of the game was put on
  indefinite hold after a man named Kenneth Lamar Noid entered a Domino's Pizza
  in Chamblee, Georgia on January 30, 1989 armed with a .357 Magnum handgun
  under delusion that Domino's owner Tom Monaghan was personally targeting him
  with the "Avoid the Noid'' advertising campaign. Mr. Noid held two Domino's
  employees hostage for almost five hours, demanding a copy of
  <em>The Widow's Son<sup>2</sup> </em>from
  <em>The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles</em> by

  <span data-wiki="error">Robert Anton Wilson</span> as penance for his
  perceived mistreatment. However, Mr. Noid soon grew hungry and demanded two
  freshly made speciality pizzas, the eating of which so preoccupied him that
  his hostages easily escaped. Following the ordeal Domino's discontinued use of
  the Noid in all North American advertising campaigns<sup>3</sup>. However, the
  Noid's popularity has surged in recent years throughout the Middle East due to
  Domino's flagship locations in Baghdad<sup>4</sup> and Tehran<sup>5</sup>.

    <sup>1</sup>The cultural traction gained by The Noid led to Pons Maar's
    casting as Saurod in <em><span data-wiki="he-man">Masters of the Universe</span></em> despite his
    extensive and exclusive history in ceramics and performance art.

    <sup>4</sup>Economists theorize that the active conflict present through the
    Baghdad region lent extra vitality and drama to the "30 Minutes or Less"
    pledge, pointing to the Domino's Baghdad Facebook profile which chronicles
    recent bombings and sectarian violence affecting the location and its
    delivery staff, sometimes in graphic detail.

    <sup>5</sup>The opening of an official Domino's location in Iran marked the
    first official corporate expansion of a U.S.-based fast food franchise in
    the country due to a longstanding trade embargo. Prior to the lifting of the
    embargo by the U.S. government, Iran became well known for bootleg versions
    of American chains including Mash Donalds, Subways, and Pizza Hats - all
    private, single-owner locations shielded from IPR-based prosecution by trade
    restrictions.
