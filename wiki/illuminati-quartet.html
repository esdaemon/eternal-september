  <strong>Illuminati Quartet<sup>Ω</sup></strong> 
  <br />
  A New York City-based experimental string quartet active throughout the 1980's. Members of the quartet were exclusively masked - any consistency in regards to personnel is therefore difficult to determine. The group collaborated often within the downtown <span data-wiki="no-wave">No Wave</span> scene, contributing strings to music by the <span data-wiki="esd">Electric Snow Dream</span> and <a href="../neon-babylon/">Neon Babylon</a>, among others. As a solo entity, the Illuminati Quartet (IQ) focused its energies primarily on both modern and medieval music - recording work Purcell<sup><span data-wiki="error"><strong>Ω</strong></span></sup>, <span data-wiki="alban-berg">Berg</span><sup><strong><span data-wiki="error">Ω</span></strong></sup>, and, perhaps most notably, <span data-wiki="error">Stockhausen</span>, whose <span data-wiki="error">Helikopter-Streichquartett</span><!--links to wiki vid--> became a staple of the group<sup>1</sup>.
