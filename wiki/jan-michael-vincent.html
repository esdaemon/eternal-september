  <strong>Jan Michael Vincent AKA JMV [related: <em>Airwolf</em>]</strong>
  <br />
  American actor primarily known for his role as the helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke in the '80's television series
  <em><span data-wiki="error">Airwolf</span></em>. Jan Michael Vincent (known colloquially as JMV) hailed from a long
  line of miscreants - his paternal grandfather was the well-known bank robber and counterfeiter Herbert Vincent. Three
  of his uncles later followed in Herbert's footsteps - and Hoy Vincent, JMV's father's brother, was shot by police in
  Tulare after resisting arrest. JMV's fame surged in the mid-'80s as <em>Airwolf</em> found a footing alongside fellow
  synthscored tech-oriented adventure shows like <em><span data-wiki="knight-rider">Knight Rider</span></em>.
  <em>Airwolf</em>'s theme song, the first on a major network to be entirely synthetic, found traction on commercial
  radio. However, amidst declining ratings and JMV's increasingly erratic behavior, <em>Airwolf</em> was canceled by CBS
  and picked up by the fringe USA Network for its fourth and final season. The show's setting was moved to Canada, with
  JMV's role significantly diminished. USA's reboot was a critical and commercial failure, in large part because budget
  constraints forced exclusive use of recycled and stock footage for all helicopter action sequences. A brief reboot
  effort followed later, focusing mainly on Stringfellow Hawke's activities as an amateur cellist<sup>1</sup>, but JMV's
  volatility continually derailed the effort. Following <em>Airwolf</em>'s cancellation JMV fell into deep despair and
  turned increasingly to drugs and alcohol, compiling numerous arrests for <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span>.
  Following a series of reckless (and some say intentional) car accidents, JMV was left with a glass blue eye, a raspy
  voice, an amputated leg, and very little memory.
