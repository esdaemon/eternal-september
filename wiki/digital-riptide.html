  <strong>Digital Riptide<sup><strong><a href="../digital-riptide/">Î©</a></strong></sup> [related: Gordon Voidwell, Leira, Metal Swans]</strong> 
  <br />
  Short-lived experimental music group active throughout the mid-to-late 1980's. Digital Riptide rose to prominence rather quickly in the city's <span data-wiki="no-wave">No Wave</span> scene based on their dynamic live performances, particularly their dueling saxophonists and the interplay of their co-lead singers <span data-wiki="error">Gordon Voidwell</span> and <span data-wiki="error">Leira</span><sup>1</sup>, who doubled as the group's guitarist<sup>2</sup>. The group was initially an extension of Voidwell's solo effort emerging from the ashes of the carnatic/jazz fusion group <span data-wiki="tetra-denim">Tetra Denim</span>. Leira, hailing originally from the <span data-wiki="coral-gables">Coral Gables</span> neighborhood of Miami, Florida, reportedly met Voidwell upon her first night in New York City. Their resultant union led to the formation of Riptide as a joint endeavour, with the couple sharing songwriting duties. The rapid rise and fall of the group paralleled the torrid creative and romantic relationship of Voidwell and Leira. Digital Riptide's creative and popular zenith occurred with its concert recording <em>Digital Riptide: Live @ <span data-wiki="error">The Pyramid</span></em>. Released locally on the REDACTED label, the album documented Riptide at the height of its powers - though the show's lyrical content and song order all but telegraphed the eventual fate of both Voidwell and Leira's union<sup>3</sup> and the group itself. Following the dissolution of the group Leira went on to front <span data-wiki="error">Metal Swans</span>, a sax-heavy, guitar driven ensemble built to showcase her compositional and instrumental talents. Voidwell, alternatively, retreated deeply into musical conceptualism, eventually embracing a <span data-wiki="error">serialistic</span> approach to songwriting - while, somewhat juxtaposingly, retained certain performative, rhythmic, and visual aspects of No Wave music. Remaining Digital Riptide members later launched splinter projects including the brutally experimental improv-based ensemble <span data-wiki="error">Black Screen o' Death</span>.

    <sup>2</sup>Forefront amongst creative tensions in the group were reported disagreements about the nature of the electric guitar's role in the group. Leira's style, marked by angular virtuosity, stood in contrast to Voidwell's tendency towards more textural and rhythmic guitar work. <br />
