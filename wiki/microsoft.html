  <strong>Microsoft Windows™ (AKA Windows™) [related: Symantec, Donald Hoffman,
    Interface Theory of Perception AKA ITP, Conscious Realism AKA CR, Multimodal User Interface Theory (MUI)]</strong>
  <br />
  A graphical navigation environment initially launched in 1985 by Microsoft as
  an operating shell of its MS-DOS. Following its release, the Windows™
  operating system came to dominate the world of personal computing, capturing
  over 90% of the market share despite its notorious vulnerability to hacking in
  the form of <span data-wiki="error">worms and viruses</span><sup>1</sup>, including the infamous government-developed exploit <span data-wiki="error">EternalBlue</span>. The
  premiere iteration of Windows™ was known as the "Executive" and included a
  visual dashboard replete with calculator, clock, clipboard, notepad, calendar,
  Reversi (a checkers-like digital game), and a rudimentary version of
  Microsoft's famed Paintbrush™ program. Following the apex of its functionality and adoption in 1998<sup>2</sup>, the
  Windows™
  platform gradually fell out of public favor. In the wake of its long tail slide into irrelevance, the system found new
  life as an allegorical model for cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman's interface theory of perception (ITP).
  Hoffman's work centers on the scientifically proven discovery that the human perceptual system has evolved to conceal
  and reduce reality in order to maximize "fitness payoffs". The ITP presents the Windows icon-based navigational system
  as a metaphor for our "mental interface"<sup>3</sup>. Objects perceived to possess a discrete identity "out there"
  are, in
  Hoffman's view, representation icons - items that can be manipulated but whose form is not indicative of objective
  reality. This system of reduction and reconstruction maximizes brain efficiency by avoiding the need to process the
  almost infinite amount of data present in underlying (fluid) reality (re: <span data-wiki="dharma">the Emptiness</span>). As a proponent of Conscious
  Realism (CR), Hoffman subscribes to the Buddhist/quantum worldview that reality has no inherent existence outside of
  observation - and that perceived reality is in fact non-physical<sup>4</sup>. Proponents of both CR and the
  Buddhist/quantum
  worldview contend that time/space, particles, and fields are in fact resultant from multimodal user
  interface<sup>5</sup> (MUI)
  indigenous to humans<sup>6</sup>. Consciousness is, in other words, fundamental. Consciousness. Is.

    <sup>1</sup>According to recent studies, it is estimated that over 80% of
    functional Windows™ operating systems are infected with a form of malware,
    with an average infiltration time of around 8 hours. In a study by Kevin
    Mitnick found that Windows™ systems unprotected by a firewall were infected
    within the first four minutes of operating. It is rumored but unproven that
    Microsoft owns a substantial amount of shadow stock in Symantec, the parent
    company of the NortonLifeLock anti-virus system, leading to the
    investigation of alleged GAAP financial reporting violations by Symantec in
    1996.

    programming/design and our misleadingly representational perceptual system. Perhaps in developing navigable digital
    technologies we've further cemented our commitment to seeing reality other than as it is. The ring of

    <sup>5</sup>Briefly: the MUI theory interlinks with ITP, essentially serving as a shorthand term for Hoffman's
    Windows-based
    theory of "representative" perception.

    <sup>6</sup>It's worth noting that Hoffman stops before reaching full-on <span

    - in his model objects (ex.
    rocks, salamanders, trees) may have some form of MUI yet lack consciousness.
