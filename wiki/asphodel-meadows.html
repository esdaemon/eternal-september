  <strong>Asphodel Meadows [related: Lethe]</strong>
  <br />
  Endless fields of the afterlife described in
  <!-- links to self but maybe not? -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Greek Mythology</span> as final resting place of the
  mediocre and unremarkable. Previous to entering the Meadows, recently deceased
  are forced to drink from the river Lethe<sup>1</sup>, thus surrendering their
  identity. Mythologist and LGBT activist Edith Hamilton describes the fields as
  being populated by "strange, pallid, ghostly flowers", perhaps referring not
  to asphodel but <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcissus.</span>

    <sup>1</sup>Lethe was commonly known in the underworld as the "river of
    unmindfulness" - a contrasting mindstate to that of

    <span data-wiki="error">enlightenment</span>. However, in the
    <em>Aeneid</em> Virgil states that it is precisely the process of entering
    complete mindless oblivion that allows a soul to reincarnate.
