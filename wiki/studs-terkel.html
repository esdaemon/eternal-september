Blacklisted for his leftist beliefs during the Age of McCarthyism, Terkel later sued <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span> to stop the communication conglomerate's unauthorized release of phone records to the newly formed <span data-wiki="error">FBI</span>, a practice instigated covertly during the United States government's no-holds-barred pursuit of the well-dressed, charismatic gangster <span data-wiki="dillinger-is-dead">John Herbert Dillinger</span> and his gang of miscreants.
