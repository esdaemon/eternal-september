  <strong><em>Perfect Strangers</em></strong>
  <br />
  American sitcom crucial to the success of ABC's late '80s TGIF Friday-night line-up. The mildly racist show centered
  on Balki Bartokomous, a wide-eyed simpleton from the mythological Mediterranean island of Mypos recently transplanted
  to the midwestern megapolis of Chicago, Illinois.

    alt="We open on the tranquil vista of a Chicagoan skyline. Delicate, wispy clouds stretch across the heavens, brushing the tips of skyscrapers. Yet our view is much more intimate, a tight zoom on an idyllic riverscape. The surrounding buildings only seem to frame the picture as our eye is drawn from right to left along a sweeping, elegant bridge... But what's this? A lone pilgrim, a sprightly young vessel, drifts merrily through the waters. It barely casts a wake, let alone a shadow -- passing below that resolute overpass. Though the boat follows its path without obstruction, the bridge draws a firm line through our panorama. Not only does it conceal the destination of our solitary subject, but it underscores the thunderous message of the piece. Held up high, splashing its way across our screens, reads the bold yellow text: PERFECT Strangers." />
