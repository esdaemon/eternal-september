  An area of <span data-wiki="error">Occult</span><sup>1</sup> scholarship centering the many mysterious and extraordinary facets of Venus, ex. <span data-wiki="black-drop">Black Drop</span> and <span data-wiki="error">Ashen Light</span>.

The underlying principles of Venusian Enigmata have been extended to other planets by various practitioners, ex. <span data-wiki="error">Saturn's Hexagon</span>, thus positioning it as adjacent to the <span data-wiki="error">Illuminati</span>-based Silurian Hypothesis.
