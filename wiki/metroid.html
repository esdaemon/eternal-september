  <strong><em>Metroid</em> [Nintendo, 1986][related: Mother Brain, Samus Aran, Black Hole Information Paradox]</strong>
  <br />
  Groundbreaking 1986 single player game-based reality simulator (<span data-wiki="vpd">VPD</span>) developed by the
  <span data-wiki="nes">Nintendo Entertainment System</span>
  for release on its original platform. Widely considered to figure heavily in the <span data-wiki="ehspf">EHSPF</span>
  series and manifestly central
  to the <span data-wiki="ehspf">MetroidVania</span> series of games. Directed by Satoru Okada and Masao Yamamoto
  (credited officially as simply
  "Yamamoto"), with music by Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka. The game was developed in a free associative environment and is
  remarkable for its open-world format and its ability to engender a sense of poignant loneliness and desperation in the
  player - a phenomenon supporting the "reality as simulation" hypothesis that has come to dominate modern
  <!-- link to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">cyber-metaphysics</span>. In this model, pixels equate to
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Planck length</span> bits (sub-microscopic non-divisible units of timespace
  that form the fabric of what consciousness perceives as "space"). By extension, reality can in fact be thought of as a
  two-dimensional information-based bit space that gives rise to complex illusory environs via
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">cybernetic</span> interaction
  with our perceptual network, thus skirting the so-called "black hole information paradox"<sup>1</sup>. Within this
  mode of
  thinking, the game's formidable end boss Mother Brain<sup>2</sup> can be seen as a malevolent omniscient figurehead
  pervading the
  simulation - a digital virus-like villian whose function is solely to ensure that the protagonist (Samus Aran/the
  player) remains locked into an endless loop-quest despite signs of its
  <!-- links so self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Brechtian</span>
  artifice in the form of glitches
  [i.e. door jumps, wall climbing, and, in later <em>Metroid</em> platforms, phazon overload and shadow freezing]. Upon
  defeat of
  The Mother Brain, its protagonist is revealed to be female, despite the use of male pronouns in the game's silver
  handbook, with a reverse correlation between the success and speed of the player's successful campaign and the
  avatar's amount of clothing. A perfect campaign results in Samus being forced to re-complete her mission, defeating
  bosses Ridley, Kraig, and The Mother Brain clad in hot pink underwear<sup>3</sup>. Samus Aran is suspended in a
  <!--PM: links to lost in norfair--><span data-wiki="error">timeless oblivion</span>, a space in which consequential movement or action is rendered
  impossible. And yet...<em>the cycle
    continues</em>.
</p>
<p><em>"And when I finally won the game in the basement of my third grade teacher's house and found that Samus was, in
    fact, a woman, I was alone - and would stay alone from that day forward".</em></p>

    effective though controversial postulated solution dubbed the "holographic principle" resolves the paradox by
