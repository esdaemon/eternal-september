  <strong>Gowanus Canal AKA Lavender Lake </strong> <br />
  Superfund site in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. At one point the most
  polluted waterway in the United States due to high concentrations of fecal
  coliforms, other pathogens (incl. "black mayonnaise"), and blebs of
  non-aqueous phase liquid. The Union St. and Carroll St. bridges are the
  primary conduits between the post-industrial wasteland of the Gowanus Valley
  and the cascading brownstone manions of Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. In
  2013 the Gowanus claimed the life of "Skippy", a 7-foot 340 pound male dolphin
  trapped in the canal, an event heavily publicized in the New York
  media<sup>1</sup>.

    <sup>1</sup>Following a necropsy by marine biologist Kimberly Dunham, it was
    revealed that "Skippy" had in fact sought out the toxic waters of the
    Gowanus in order to self-euthanize. At the time of his death, the dolphin
    was suffering from kidney stones, stomach ulcers, parasites, mental illness,
    and had not eaten in almost 30 days.
