  <strong>BitCoin [related: Satoshi Nakamoto, Paul Le Roux]</strong> <br />
  A mysterious and controversial decentralized digital pseudo-currency invented in the late 1990s by a person or group of persons acting under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite its lack of central control and shrouded origin, it has found support among celebrities (ex. <span data-wiki="steven-seagal">Steven Seagal</span><sup>1</sup>) and, even, national governments (El Salvador). Currently, it is estimated that around 54% of BitCoin interactions involve illegal activity, including - but in no manner limited to - ransomware attacks (ex: <span data-wiki="eternalblue">EternalBlue</span>), money laundering, and the digital purchase of illicit goods and information. Although Nakamoto's identity remains unconfirmed, many journalists claim him to be Paul Le Roux, a programmer and former drug cartel boss. Le Roux is currently serving as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Agency after being convicted of <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span> trafficking. He later confessed to the murder of seven business associates and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. No verifiable electronic transmissions from Satoshi Nakamoto have been identified since the first day of Le Roux's incarceration.
