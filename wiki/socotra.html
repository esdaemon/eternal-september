  <strong>Socotra AKA Soqotra</strong> 
  <br />
  An secessionist island off the coast of The Republic of Yemen in the Indian Ocean currently under the control of the UAE. Extraordinarily isolated for thousands of years, Socotra is commonly known as "the most alien-looking place on earth". It is estimated that up to 34% of its flora is endemic, including the startingly strange Dragon's Blood "upside down" tree.
