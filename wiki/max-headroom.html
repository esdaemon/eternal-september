  <strong>Max Headroom</strong> <br />
  Debuting in 1985, Max Headroom was the first computer generated television personality. Headroom emerged from a
  dystopian future dominated by advertising-based television controlled by a small conglomerate of large tech
  corporations dubbed The Network, an entity oft compared to <span data-wiki="skynet-syndrome">SkyNet</span>. The
  Network
  functioned with full governmental
  authority, passing laws against turning off television sets and using various forms of cathode ray technology to
  monitor viewers movements and communication. Headroom's <span data-wiki="a-i">A.I.</span> system was generated from
  the memories of activist
  journalist Edison Carter, the only dissenting voice from within the Network and the public's sole source of
  unadulterated information. Headroom's name was auto-generated from Carter's last memory before perishing in a
  suspicious accident in a parking garage: the sign "MAX HEADROOM, 2.3H" (delineating an overhead clearance of 2.3
  meters). On November 22, 1987, the Max Headroom A.I. was used to hijack the signal of two television stations in
  Chicago during an airing of the Dr. Who serial "Horror of Fang Rock"<sup>1</sup> in an act of video piracy. Throughout
  the
  83-second intrusion, Max Headroom displayed cryptic and erratic behavior, repeatedly degrading

  <span data-wiki="error">New Coke</span><sup>2</sup>, singing "I
  Know I'm Losing You" by the Temptations, whistling the Clutch Cargo<sup>3</sup> theme and later referencing its final
  episode,
  "The Big X"<sup>4</sup>. The intrusion culminated in Headroom's bare buttocks being struck repeatedly with a fly
  swatter. A
  reward of $100,000 was offered by the FCC for any information regarding the incident, but the culprits behind the
  hijacking and their methodology remain, to this day, unidentified. The incident was anchored around Network 23, a
  number referenced repeatedly in the intrusion, perhaps as a nod to the
