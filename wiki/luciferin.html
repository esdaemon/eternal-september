  <strong>Luciferin [related: Lucifer, The Palladium]</strong>
  <br />
  Standard scientific term for light-emitting compounds found in organic beings
  generating bioluminescence, including fireflies, snails, and various forms of
  bacteria. Etymology: from "Lucifer" [Greek: ἑωσφόρος] aka Dawn Bringer aka The
  Morning Star aka The Bringer of Light. Associated with the appearance of Venus
  in the morning sky,
  <em>its luminosity persists despite the glare of the sun</em>. In Bogomil and
  Cathar text Lucifer is depicted as the older brother of Jesus who has fallen
  from Heaven and established his own kingdom, of which he is the
  <em>Demiurge<sup>1</sup></em>, in essence creating the physical world in order to divide and trap the
  non-corporeal spirits of Heaven inside matter<sup>2</sup>. Various forms of
  Christian
  <!-- links to self  -->
  <span data-wiki="error">apocrypha</span> portray Lucifer as not the
  Antichrist but as a positive, if complicated, figure, ex: as the embodiment of
  manifest destiny. Numerous Latin texts refer to John the Baptist with the term
  Lucifer (<em>"you are the true light bringer of the world"</em>), and selected
  texts in fact use Lucifer as the title of Jesus himself, merging the
  dichotomous entities into one, presenting in essence a

  worldview. Regarding the paschal candle and its function in the Easter
  Proclamation:

  <em>"Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat: ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit
    occasum. Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi
    serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! It is he who bears the Light, intolerable
    blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish souls. Doubt it not!"</em>

    <sup>2</sup>Late in the 19th century, French journalist Léo Taxil
    perpetuated what has been called the "Taxil hoax", an elaborate exposé
    uncovering deep associations between
    <!-- links to self -->
    <span data-wiki="error">Freemasonry</span> and Luciferian worship. His
    efforts centered around promotion of a book entitled
    <em>Freemasonry Disclosed</em> (1897) described the presence of a highly
    secret <span data-wiki="luciferin">Satanist</span> ruling body called The
    Palladium. A resultant counter-campaign later claimed, without proof, that
    Taxil himself had written the book.
