  <strong>Luciferin [related: Lucifer, The Palladium, Luciferianism] [disambiguation: <span data-wiki="error">Satanism</span>]</strong>
  <br />
  Standard scientific term for light-emitting compounds found in organic beings generating bioluminescence, including fireflies, snails, and various forms of bacteria. Etymology: from "Lucifer" [Greek: Ἑωσφόρος] aka Dawn Bringer aka The Morning Star aka The Bringer of Light. Associated with the appearance of <!--link to venusian enigmata (not venetian pool?)--><span data-wiki="error">Venus</span> in the morning sky, <em>its luminosity persists despite the glare of the sun</em>. In Bogomil and Cathar text Lucifer is depicted as the older brother of Jesus who has fallen from Heaven and established his own kingdom, of which he is the <em><span data-wiki="error">Demiurge</span></em><sup>1</sup>, in essence creating the physical world in order to divide and trap the non-corporeal spirits of Heaven inside matter<sup>2</sup>. Various forms of Christian <span data-wiki="error">apocrypha</span > portray Lucifer as not the Antichrist but as a positive, if complicated, figure, ex: as the embodiment of manifest destiny. Numerous Latin texts refer to John the Baptist with the term Lucifer (<em>"you are the true light bringer of the world"</em>), and selected texts in fact use Lucifer as the title of Jesus himself, merging the dichotomous entities into one, presenting in essence a <span data-wiki="error">Buddhist</span> non-dualistic worldview. Luciferianism, thus refers to the scholarly study and practice of Luciferian "light-based"<sup>3</sup> beliefs and concepts: the validity of subjective experience, the supremacy of knowledge over faith, the ability of man to overcome the cybernetic mystery of his own existence by the power of his own reason. <span data-wiki="error">Satanism</span>, a sacrificially-oriented (and often performative) ritualistic practice, is often confused with Luciferianism, a much more philosophical and historically-based system of belief.

  <em>"Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat: ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit occasum. Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum."</em>

    <sup>2</sup>Late in the 19th century, French journalist Léo Taxil
    perpetuated what has been called the "Taxil hoax", an elaborate exposé
    uncovering deep associations between
    <!-- links to self -->
    <span data-wiki="error">Freemasonry</span> and Luciferian worship. His
    efforts centered around promotion of a book entitled
    <em>Freemasonry Disclosed</em> (1897) described the presence of a highly
    secret <span data-wiki="luciferin">Satanist</span> ruling body called The
    Palladium. A resultant counter-campaign later claimed, without proof, that
    Taxil himself had written the book.
