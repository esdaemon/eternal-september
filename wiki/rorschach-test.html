  <strong>Rorschach Test</strong> <br />
  Psychological test outlined in Hermann Rorschach's 1921 book <em>Psychodiagnostik</em>, released a year before the
  author's untimely death at the age of 37. The test involves the algorithmic analysis of patient responses to a series
  of seemingly random inkblots. The test is used extensively to verify <span

  Throughout the 1960's Rorschach inkblot tests were used extensively to "diagnose" homosexuality, which was at that
  time considered a
  psychopathology. Prominent in such diagnosis were patient blot interpretations centering around genitalia (both male
  and female)<sup>2</sup> and female clothing. Following the accidental release of "internal" documentation (read: hack)
  from the
  NIPP (National Society of Psychology and Psychotherapy) in 1972 it was revealed that only by identifying all inkblots
  as either butterflies, moths, or, in once instance, the face of an owl, could the test be "aced" and the patient be
  considered of sound mind.

  <p><sup>2</sup>As evident by the samples below, a portion of the inkblots comprising the Rorschach test appear to be
    purposefully modelled after the female vulva or male taint, leading to speculation that the test was in fact at
    least partly a tool used to institutionalize homosexuals throughout the civil rights movement.</p>
