  <strong>Bicameralism [AKA "Two Chambers"][related: Julian Jaynes]</strong>
  <br />
  Refers to a hypothesis coined by psychological researcher Julian Jaynes
  following his time in prison as a conscientious objector to the Second World
  War postulating that the human mind was once discretely divided into two
  separate "chambers" of activity<sup>1</sup>. Jaynes posits that only experiential links
  between these two spheres of activity were auditory hallucinations, resulting
  in a normalized experience of diety-attributed vocal commands (AKA "the voice
  of God"). According to Jaynes, bicameralism evolved into our current
  integrated unicameral cognitive configuration towards the end of the
  Mediterranean Bronze Age due to the presence of extreme environmental
  stressors. In retroflection, it is thought that non-genetic
  <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> can be seen as a
  de-evolution into a bicameral state. Jayne used his theory to validate the
  <span data-wiki="tower-of-babel">Tower of Babel</span> parable as a literal
  occurrence resulting from mass confusion/hysteria over the sudden
  societal-wide loss of verbal non-auditory commands. Bicameralism is but one
  example of ways in which seemingly miraculous factual historical occurrences
  have been systematically and erroneously discounted (i.e. attributed to
  "legend", "faith-based naivety", "magic", etc.) by Newtonian pseudo-science, a
  concept supported in great depth by the work of
