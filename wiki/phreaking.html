  <strong>Phreaking [related: Trigger Tone]</strong> <br />
  A hacking term derived from a mash-up of <em>phone </em>and
  <em>freak. </em>The expression originated as a colloquialism for the reverse
  engineering of long distance phone calls via audio tone generation. The
  origins of phone phreaking trace back to the automation of

  <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span> switchboards in the 1950's via the
  implementation of in-band signaling. The system, developed internally,
  included the use of secret or shrouded tones to signal various functions
  within the network. For example, a tone of 2600 Hz<sup>1</sup> was used to
  trigger the end of a call and the opening of a usable long distance line. Use
  of this tone was first discovered and manipulated via precise whistling by
  <span data-wiki="joybubbles">Joybubbles</span>, a blind seven-year old with
  perfect pitch from Richmond, Virginia. Following exploitation of its initial
  system, Ma Bell developed multi-frequency or MF<sup>2</sup> tones. However a
  document detailing the use and production of these new frequencies entitled
  the <em>Bell System Technical Journal </em>was mistakenly released to the
  public by the company in the late 1950's - an incident subsequently blamed on
  the burgeoning (but notoriously passive) phreaking community, including
  members of the <span data-wiki="he-man">Masters of Deception</span>. In June of
  1972, <em><span data-wiki="ramparts-magazine">Ramparts</span></em> magazine
  published an article entitled "Regulating the Phone Company in Your Home"
  outlining schematics for replicable construction of a "

    <sup>2</sup>Known within the phreaking community as "Marty Freidman" tones -
    commonly understood as reference to the former Megadeth guitarist of the
    same name. An outspoken opponent to "shredding", Marty relocated to Tokyo in
    the late 1990s and subsequently starred as Paul Weinberg, an English language teacher,
    in Isshin Inudou's <em>Gou-Gou Datte Neko de Aru</em>.

    <em>"Shredders are the guys in your friendâ€™s basement who play insanely fast,
      and it just looks so mind-blowing and amazingly cool with their fingers
      flying all around the neck, but if you close your eyes and actually
      listen, what you hear is a pile of shit. It's ego music, akin to
      masturbation - actually, to wanting someone else to watch you masturbate.
      It's not a gift of joy, it's like a navel-gazing journey down a dark chasm
      of nothingness - the siren song of a twisted mind. I prefer the economy,
      the sculpted beauty and concision of
