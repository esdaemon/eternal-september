  <strong>Obelisk</strong> <br />
  Although the term is derived from Ancient Greek, "obelisk" most often refers to towering four-sided tapering
  sculptures built by the Ancient Egyptians. Monolithic (or single-stoned) in construction, the largest of the Egyptian
  obelisks are essentially immovable without modern technology, weighing in some cases over 25 tons. Modern scientists
  have attempted to reverse engineer the erection of Egyptian obelisks, with no consensus emerging as to how (or why)
  they were initially constructed. Most obelisks, both ancient and modern, are topped with a

  speculation that their initial development was related in some form to the ancient Egyptian pursuit of sustainable
  energy generation and pre-digital wi-fi. Obelisk monuments were also characteristic of ancient Assyrian, Nubian, and
  Axumite cultures. The Washington Monument, perhaps the most notable modern obelisk, is topped with an aluminum apex.
  Completed in 1884, the structure's likeness to an erect caucasian penis has come to symbolize American recklessness
  and hubris throughout the world.
