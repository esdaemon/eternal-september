  <strong>Schizophrenia [AKA Schizoaffective Disorder]</strong>
  <br />
  A mental disorder characterized by bizarre and persecutory delusions,
  passivity phenomena (the feeling that thoughts are being inserted into one's
  mind), the sudden and dramatic appearances of discrete <span data-wiki="alters">alters</span>, and an addiction to nicotine (80-90% of patients diagnosed with the
  disorder are lifelong smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population).
  Three notable risk factors in developing the disease are 1) being born in
  winter or early spring resulting in fetal Vitamin D deficiency 2) abuse of
  cannabis (especially in the form of water bongs) and/or narcotics and 2) being an identical
  twin, either literally or figuratively. Negative symptoms (symptoms most
  prominent outside of schizophrenic episodes) include alogia (poverty of
  speech) and blunted affect/flat expression. Patients with treatment resistant
  schizophrenia are often administered

  Clozapine (see also: Risperidone), a medication often resulting in Tardive
  Dyskensia, a disorder characterized by involuntary grimacing, sticking out of
  the tongue, and smacking of the lips. The medication's mechanism of action is
  currently unclear to scientists. Clozapine is often prescribed off-label to
  treat Parkinson's disease, despite the illness's many commonalities with
  Tardive Dyskensia. Current schizoaffective modeling maps the disease as a
  vector rather than a binary, a graduative sinking in and out of gradient
  levels bicameralism in accordance with various environmental factors. However,
  those diagnosed with the disease still cite a "snap into" or "sudden onset"
  moment in their cycle of de-/re-personalization. In <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist doctrine</span> schizophrenia is thought to represent a core divide between self/non-self, a veritable <span data-wiki="digital">digitization</span> of the fundamental fluidity of being.

  <em>"At last he appears, a bridge over that interminable, untraversable mental
    abyss - the gravel-throated Hollywood villain, prodding me towards some
    alternate threshold, flirting with his own annihilation. Sounding both far
    away and close, both innately "other" and supremely indegenous to my aural
    mind."</em>
