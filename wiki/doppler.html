  <strong>Doppler AKA The Doppler Effect</strong> 
  <br />
  The alteration of perceived wave frequency when the observer is moving in relation to the source of the wave. First posited by the Austrian scientist Christian Doppler in his 1842 treatise "On the Coloured Light of the Binary Stars and Some Other Stars of the Heavens and Other Things" and later experimentally confirmed by Buys Ballot by having a string ensemble play a single highly calibrated  sustained tone on a moving train<sup>1</sup>. Modern quantum physicists see the Doppler effect as an early shift towards observer-dependent relativism, a concept fundamental to the <span data-wiki="error">Buddhist/Quantum Worldview</span>. The Doppler Effect is known to accentuate the psychosomatic effect of music sounding sad when someone is driving away from you in a car with the radio on, especially at dusk and/or for an inexplicable reason.
