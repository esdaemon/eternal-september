  <strong>Konami AKA Konami Holdings Corporation [related: Capcom]</strong>
  <br />
  Japanese tech conglomerate established on March 21, 1950 as Tokyo Products. Konami, along with Capcom and others, was central to the emergent hyper-structural portal functionality (<span data-wiki="ehspf">EHSPF</span>) of oft Alien-oriented 8-bit
  interfaces for the Nintendo Entertainment
  System (<span data-wiki="nes">NES</span>). Base structure includes the titles
  <em>Lifeforce, Esper's Dream, <span data-wiki="top-gun">Top Gun</span>,
    <span data-wiki="metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</span>,
    <span data-wiki="contra">Contra</span>, Quarth, Aliens</em>
  (Arcade only), and, to a certain extent, <em>Castlevania</em> and
  <em>Trojan</em>. En masse this subset of games was thought to function as a
  virtual portal between realities (<span data-wiki="vpd">VPD</span>), with the
  game's creators shielded behind a translucent yet impenetrable veil, perhaps
  made of mirrored glass somehow presenting itself as continually cascading
  liquid metal (re: <em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day </em>starring
  <span data-wiki="arnold-schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</span>). Through
  the 90's and into the 00's, Konami came to be defined by the exploits of <span data-wiki="error">Hideo Kojima</span>, mastermind of the
  <em><span data-wiki="metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</span></em> series.
