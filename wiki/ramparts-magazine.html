  <strong><em>Ramparts</em> Magazine [1962-1975]</strong> <br />
  Preeminent Catholic magazine of the New Left, <em>Ramparts </em>was notable
  for its graphic sophistication and hard hitting (sometimes controversial)
  reporting. Launched in <span data-wiki="error">Silicon Valley</span>,
  <em>Ramparts </em>was an early opponent of the Vietnam War<sup>1</sup> and
  published graphic photos of South Asian children killed and maimed in the
  conflict<sup>2</sup>.

  Throughout its tenure, the magazine raised a de facto war on the surveillance
  community, publishing a series of expos√©s on links between the <span data-wiki="error">CIA</span> and the
  National Student Association (NSA), Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and the
  Asia Foundation. <em>Ramparts </em>also received acclaim for featuring the
  extended diaries of both Che Guevara and

  <em>Ramparts</em> engaged in intentional obfuscation of its finances - it was
  widely speculated to operate at a significant loss owing to its glossy
  production and extensive reporting costs. In the late 1960's, the CIA launched
  an investigation of the magazine, citing both suspicious financial activity
  and reported (but later debunked) Soviet ties<sup>4</sup>. In 1972
  <em>Ramparts</em> was sued by

  <span data-wiki="cybernetics">black box</span>" enabling free long distance calls, resulting in the magazine's bankruptcy.
