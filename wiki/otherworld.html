  Science fiction television series canceled midway through its debut  season. The <em>Otherworld</em><sup>1</sup> pilot centers on events stemming from a suburban family's visit to the Great <span data-wiki="error">Pyramid</span> of Giza. Due to an unforeseen once-in-ten-thousand-year alignment with <span data-wiki="error">Alpha Draconis</span>, the family is transported to Thel, a parallel reality divided into isolated <span data-wiki="error">Zones</span>, patrolled by Zone Troopers. Thel is governed by the Church of <span data-wiki="ai">Artificial Intelligence</span> (CAI) - a state-mandated religion centering on the principles of <span data-wiki="cybernetics">cybernetics</span> as applied to technological development. The CAI practices are facilitated by electronic "worship modules'' and no other belief system is permitted. At the center of Thel and surrounded by one-eyed Egyptian <span data-wiki="obelisk">obelisks</span> is the scenic and utopian city of Imar<sup>2</sup>. <em>Otherworld</em> was created and directed by the auteur American poet, screenwriter, and recording artist Roderick Falconer. After signing a recording contract with Geffen Records, Falconer's career in television again faltered with the unsold Android-focused pilot <em>Annihilator</em><sup>3</sup>.
