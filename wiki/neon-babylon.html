  <strong>Neon Babylon<sup><strong><a href="../neon-babylon/">Î©</a></strong></sup></strong> 
  <br />
  A mythologically-oriented musical ensemble of fluid membership and unclear origin.  The group's musical style was marked by the juxtaposition between modern analog synthesizers and more traditional instrumentation such as strings, acoustic percussion, and harpsichord. Documentation of the group is limited to a handful of mono recordings and a series of VHS concert videos featuring <span data-wiki="error">occult</span> imagery. Lyrically, the group focused largely on a grab bag of Illuminati-related subjects, including the <span data-wiki="error">Silurian Hypothesis</span>, <span data-wiki="error">Saturn's Hexagon</span>, and the significance of <span data-wiki="error">Alpha Draconis</span>, as well as the wider world of the ancient mythologies surrounding the Levant. Neon Babylon's activity often overlapped with that of the masked <span data-wiki="error">Illuminati Quartet</span>. As with the quartet, the visages of Neon Babylon members were most often shrouded, either with masks<sup>1</sup> or crude analog effects. Individual singers from the performance art collective <span data-wiki="error">Shepherds of Apocrypha</span> were, at times, featured in various Neon Babylon materials, singing or sprechgesang-ing in both German and Latin.
