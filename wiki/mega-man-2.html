  <strong><em>Mega Man 2</em></strong> <br />
  Open world action/adventure platform released by the <span data-wiki="nes">Nintendo Entertainment System</span> in
  Japan in 1988 and
  internationally in 1989. Following the commercial failure of <em>Mega Man</em>, the title's design team decided to
  complete the
  series' second installment pro bono, freeing them to pursue a more abstract and expressionistic direction. Oft cited
  as one of the as one of the most compelling video game titles in history<sup>1</sup>, <em>Mega Man 2</em> was renowned
  for the
  depth of
  it's emotional story line<sup>2</sup>. As per the game's lore, the actions of the robot <em>Mega Man</em> are
  controlled by his
  creator/enemy Dr. Light (or Licht in German) via his radio-capable helmet. <span data-wiki="mega-man-2">
    <em>Mega Man 2</em>'s stunning final
    sequence
  </span>
  frequently generates a cathartic outpouring of emotion from the player. Following a treacherous passage to his hidden
  lair, MegaMan's central antagonist Dr. Wiley morphs into a levitating reptilian creature<sup>3</sup> with pulsating
  lungs. The
  game's final battle is soundtracked with silence - even the sound of jumping/shooting is muted<sup>4</sup>, creating a
  stiflingly
  oppressive environment. Following the final defeat of Dr. Wiley, the soundtrack is lifted... the sound of <em>
    breathing...
    labored... remains... the warrior... returns home... on foot... a journey spanning five full seasons... including
    "cherry blossom time"... upon arrival... the helmet... his prison... looms... on a hill.. in grass so green ...
    so...
    fucking... green.
