  <strong>The Baconator</strong> 
  <br />
  Consisting of six strips of bacon, two beef patties, mayonnaise, ketchup, and cheese served on a toasted bun, The Baconator was reportedly responsible for a significant increase in sales at Wendy's, with some estimates suggesting the dish to be single-handedly responsible for an 18% growth in the company's market share in the two years following its unveiling.  The Baconator's success has been largely attributed to the product's innovative marketing campaign by analysts. Centering on an obese fictional character named "BaconatorMan", the campaign marked a significant departure from Wendy's prolonged and tepidly received focus on "freshness", instead embracing a more caloric, bacon-heavy approach. The Triple Baconator, a variation of the dish that includes three additional strips of bacon, was for a time the most calorically dense single item on any menu in the United States, at almost 1800 calories per serving, though it was later surpassed by the Australian-themed Outback Steakhouse’s <span data-wiki="bloomin-onion">Bloomin’ Onion™</span>.
