  <strong>Knight Rider [related: KITT, disambiguation:

  <br />
  Television dystopian sci-fi drama created and produced by Glen A. Larson that
  ran from 1982 to 1986. The show centered around the Knight Industries Two
  Thousand (KITT, serial # AD227529), an advanced male-identifying sentient form
  of <span data-wiki="ai">A.I.</span> housed in a nearly indestructible and
  highly fashionable Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. KITT was designed by the late
  billionaire Wilton Knight (founder of Founder for Law and Government AKA FLAG)
  based on

  <span data-wiki="cybernetics">cybernetic</span> principles of emergent
  consciousness. The "brain" of the unit is an extremely powerful
  microprocessor<sup>1</sup> placed at the center of a series of almost infinite
  interlocking cybernetic logic modules, allowing the unit to think, learn,
  develop language, and, eventually, self-awareness and behavioural
  autonomy<sup>2</sup>. KITT was extremely self-conscious in his human
  interaction, a result of his awareness of only recently having gained
  sentience, with an easily bruised ego and generally self-effacing and
  sometimes defensive demeanor, despite possessing superior intelligence and
  processing power<sup>3</sup>. KITT's nefarious predecessor was KARR (Knight
  Automated Roving Robot), a model placed in a secret storage facility following
  [REDACTED] due to KARR's prime operating directive of self-preservation.
  Subsequently, KITT was programmed to protect and preserve human life at all
  costs, leading to numerous self-sacrificial acts culminating in apparent
  self-euthanization upon the realization that

    <sup>1</sup>As stated on the show, KITT's central processing unit contained
    upwards of 100MB of memory with a one nanosecond access time.

    <sup>2 </sup>It should be noted here the possibility of extrapolating
    <span data-wiki="bicameralism">Jaynes</span>'s principle of bicameralism onto a
    drastically larger system. Essentially, KITT began processing from a
    multi-cameral functionality, with almost countless discrete processing loops
    operating simultaneously and the central mainframe acting as a coordinating
    unit. Through the stress of KITT's various missions commonly involved a call
    to direct action, complex moral quandaries including the valuing of one
    lifeform against another, and high speed wrong-way chases through the
    streets of <span data-wiki="los-angeles">Los Angeles</span>, KITT's develop
    was forcibly funnelled down a path of integration. Although never explicitly
    stated by Wilton Knight, it is reasonable to conclude that KITT's processing
    unit was purposely placed within a context of maximum distress in order to
    facilitate the process of cameral unification, a theory supported by the
    fact that the unit was installed previously (and unsuccessfully) in a static
    Washington D.C.-based governmental system charged with compiled various
    streams of

    <sup>3</sup>In effort to quell his uneasiness surrounding human interaction,
    KITT was equipped with an in-console arcade and stereo system, a
    state-of-the-art interface KITT often used as an interference device to
    distract his "drivers" during situations requiring the mitigation of human
    error and inferior processing ability.
