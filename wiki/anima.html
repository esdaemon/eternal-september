  <strong>Anima [related: Carl Jung, Synchronicity]</strong> 
  <br />
  Core principle of Swiss philosopher and psychiatrist Carl Jung's concept of the collective unconscious<sup>1</sup>. The anima in males is the feminine, and the anima in females is the masculine - both suppressed states of being that must be integrated into <span data-wiki="the-self">Self</span> to form whole personhood. Jung felt that the hyper-gendered patterns of habituation present in contemporary European society contributed deeply to mass psychosis and a penchant for war and conflict. Part of his analysis included the study of peace loving ancient and indigenous societies with more fluid public concepts of gender, including the Dogon.  Jung was, for a time, a devoted disciple of <span data-wiki="error">Sigmund Freud</span d>. However, Jung's concept of anima contradicted Freud's insistence that the libido was the primary driver of the subconscious, leading to a severe and permanent rift between the men<sup>2</sup>. A period of extreme isolation and ostracization followed for Jung. With his career irrevocably derailed due to Freud's vindictive retaliation, Jung experienced what has been described as a psychological break and a spiritual transformation<sup>3</sup>. Having been dropped by his publisher, Jung took to documenting his experiences in two colossal <span data-wiki="codex">codices</span>, the <em>Red Book</em> and the <em>Black Book</em>. Jung left no posthumous instructions for these materials following his untimely death. For forty years the manuscripts remained secret until Ulrich Hoenri, Jung's ne'er-do-well grandson, auctioned the publishing rights while experiencing gambling-related financial distress. During this time, two technicians from an unknown and possibly nefarious organization called DigitalFusion<sup>4</sup> were able to scan over 10,000 of the books' pages. The material was subsequently leaked onto the deep web in the early 2000's and monetized with digital ads. Experts who have negotiated the books describe them as "unhinged, bombastic, and startingly mystical", including extensive passages featuring illuminated drawings in what appears to be in some kind of <span data-wiki="enochian">antediluvian language</span><sup>5</sup>. Topics covered include UFO's, <span data-wiki="error">Gnosticism</span>, infidelity<sup>6</sup>, the I-Ching, ESP, synchronicity<sup>7</sup> as it relates to <span data-wiki="error">quantum theory</span>, and a refutation of the biblical <em>Book of Job</em>.
