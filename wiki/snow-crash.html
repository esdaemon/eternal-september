  <strong>Snow Crash [related: Complexity Theory]</strong>
  <br />
  Software failure mode generated by the limitless quantification of random
  nonsensical data that is then forcibly incorporated into a finite bitmap
  (traditional 8-bit) resulting in a complete wipe of memory and functionality
  (AKA the white void of nothingness, the quadratic abyss) and the sudden onset
  appearance of channel static television fuzz. Within cyber-metaphysics, "snow
  crash" is often equated with the human phenomenon of mental breakdowns [see:
  <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>]. According to complexity
  theory<sup>1</sup>, randomized numerous stressors that either 1) are in fact
  limitless or 2) are perceived to be virtually limitless can lead to the
  fracturing of core functioning into discrete units, thus severing the system's
  <span data-wiki="cybernetics">cybernetic</span> feedback loop. In this sense, the
  concept of complexity-induced breakdowns clearly applies to both organic
  (brain) and inorganic (computer) processing units - a concept supported by the
  reports of "undulating, randomly patterned mind wipes on the surface of an
  endless oceanic void" (AKA grey waves) by patients under observation following
  pronounced psychotic breaks.

    <sup>1</sup>It is perhaps worth noting here the higher rates of documented
    psychological distress in veterans of recent nonsensical, highly complex and
    morally ambiguous/abstract wars (Vietnam War,
    <span data-wiki="tikrit">Desert Storm</span>, the "War on Terror") verses
    veterans of World War I and World War II (conflicts with higher levels of
    overall brutality and carnage but featuring physicalized battlegrounds and
    clearly delineated "sides" AKA a central moralistic binary system.
