  <br />
  Anti-tech feminist manifesto by James Cameron staring
  <span data-wiki="arnold-schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</span>,
  centering on SkyNet<sup>1</sup>, a sentient machine-based post-corporate
  lifeform capable of unidirectional time travel. The film originated from
  Cameron's fever dream of a metallic torso using long blades to drag itself
  from a large explosion. The film was shot largely in the abandoned downtown
  area of Los Angeles now known as Skid Row at night without proper permits,
  with Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd, the film's producer<sup>2</sup>, claiming the
  film was a UCLA student project when confronted by police.
