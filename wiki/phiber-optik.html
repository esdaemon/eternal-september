  <strong><span data-wiki="error">Phiber Optik</span> [related: @Cafe]</strong> <br />
  An American hacker, cryptographer, and infosec expert, formerly a member of
  the legendary hacker group(s) <span data-wiki="error">Legion of Doom</span>/<span data-wiki="error">Masters of Deception</span> and core
  member of the <span data-wiki="mindvox">MindVox</span> launch team. Optik
  first came into contact with computers around the age of nine at a local
  department store frequented by his parents (both clinical shopaholics).
  Shortly thereafter, he came into possession of a TRS-80 MC-10 with 4k of RAM
  and a 32 column CAPSLOCK interface which he hooked up to a television set and
  portable tape recorder for program storage and activation. A self-proclaimed
  autodidact, Optik quickly learned to implement and advance cutting edge
  programming techniques learned via manuals stolen from his local library,
  establishing himself as a bright young star of the larging hacking community.
  From 1990-1992, Optik faced a myriad of legal issues stemming from his alleged
  role in

  <span data-wiki="error">AT&T</span> Global Server Network Crash in
  1990<sup>1</sup>. Widespread surveillance and subsequent evidence planting
  culminated in Optik's service of a one-year sentence in federal prison in
  South Philadelphia. Upon release, he was hailed
  as the "Robin Hood of Cyberspace" and frequently held court at the
  @Cafe, New York's first dedicated internet
  cafe. Optik is now rumored to reside in

  Abene as a consultant for various tech-security firms.

    <sup>1</sup>Although AT&T later admittedly the crash was entirely the result
    of a flawed internal update, Optik and other LoD/MoD members were never
    cleared of involvement.

    <sup>2</sup>Despite extensive media coverage, general public renown, and
    dirt cheap rent in New York's Alphabet City, @Cafe was a financial failure,
    operating at a significant loss throughout its life due in large part to its
    dedicated <span data-wiki="t-1-carrier">T1 line</span>, reportedly costing
    over $10,000/month.
