  Commonly known as "The Governator" - an Austrian-born actor and bodybuilder
  and the 38th Governor of California. Born in 1947 in Thal, Styria to Aurelia
  and Gustav Schwarzenegger<sup>1</sup>, Arnold began lifting weights at age 15
  becoming quickly obsessed with the practice<sup>2</sup>, seeing it as his
  "ticket to America". Upon his arrival in California, Arnold trained
  exclusively at Gold's Gym, becoming close with Superstar Billy Graham and Ric
  Drasin, both fairly well-known professional wrestlers. In 1970, Schwarzenegger
  captured the Mr. Olympia title, a feat he would repeat seven times in
  succession - his training funded in part by a series of photoshoots for
  <em>After Dark</em>, a gay men's magazine. He later admittedly to regular
  steroid use throughout the 1970's, a habit he reportedly ended upon finding
  Transcendental Meditation (TM) in 1977. Arnold began his acting career in 1970
  with <em>Hercules in New York</em>, a poorly received film in which
  Schwarzenegger's unintelligible english dialogue had to be replaced via
  overdub in post production. <span data-wiki="error">James Cameron</span>'s dystopian sci-fi feminist

  (1984) marked Schwarzenegger's ascent into superstardom - success that was
  quickly followed by further futuristic/surreal action films such as
  <em>Predato</em>r and <em>Total Recall</em>. Via special election,
  Schwarzenegger won the Californian governorship in 2003, later serving a
  second term. He was divorced from his longtime spouse Maria Shriver (niece of
  former American president John F. Kennedy) in 2011 after he was found to have
  fathered a child with their former housemaid.

    <sup>1</sup>Gustav was a vocal member of the Nazi party and verbally and
    physically abusive for fear from the unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not
    his biological child.

    <sup>2</sup>Arnold was absent from both his brother's and father's funerals
    so as to not disrupt his training regimen. He was also declared AWOL from a
    mandatory stint in the Austrian while attending a string bodybuilding
    competitions, thus risking jail time and jeopardizing a possible return to
    his home country.
