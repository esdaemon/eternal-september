  <strong>Viewtron [related: <span data-wiki="error">AT&T</span> Sceptre]</strong>
  <br />
  <span data-wiki="knight-ridder">Knight Ridder</span>'s online videotex system
  modeled after the British Post Office's Prestel and deployed exclusively on
  the AT&T Sceptre<sup>1</sup> graphic terminal. Viewtron developed strategic
  brand partnerships with the <em>Miami Herald</em>, JC Penny, and others. From
  the outset, the project was designed to appeal specifically to the tech-phobic
  consumers, at times mailing written directions to its users or notifying
  customers of new applications via automated phone messages AKA RoboCalls. The
  service was later named by PC Magazine as the biggest project failure of
  all-time in the field of Information Technology, despite it's phone-based
  customer service receiving a conglomerated 99.9% satisfaction rating. The
  Viewtron service was initially launched via installation in 125 homes located
  throughout the upscale neighborhood of
  <span data-wiki="error">Coral Gables</span>, Florida in 1980, an initiative
  dubbed "Bowsprit" by the company. Despite the rapid growth of the service in
  the following years it was determined by Knight Ridder that the vast majority
  of subscribers used the service for various kinds of secure "

  <span data-wiki="error">pink messaging</span>", perhaps paralleling the end-use of
  <span data-wiki="videotex">Minitel</span>. Throughout Knight Ridder's
  operation of Viewtron it maintained an almost authoritarian resistance to the
  development of any kind of interactive features, fearing they would lead to "a
  dystopia without newspapers, where [truth is relative and information is
  generated primarily by the user and exchanged rapidly and without expert
  oversight]".

    <sup>1</sup>The Sceptre used a standard television set for display and
    included an infrared wireless keyboard and integrated 1200/75 baud 7-bit
    modem. Required for the proper display of NAPLPS geometry-specified pages,
    the Sceptre was initially offered to residents of Coral Gables at a discount
    of $600, with plans for a wide release at $900 (it was reported that each
    unit cost over $1200 to manufacture not including shipping). Upon Sceptre's
    discontinuation in 1986 it was estimated AT & T had lost over $80 million
    dollars on the venture.
