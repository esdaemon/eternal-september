  A manufacturer of pre-<span data-wiki="internet">internet</span> computer

  used by

  <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span>, I.B.M., and other
  techno-conglomerates. Established in California's Santa Clara Valley in 1961,
  Memorex was initially based in what would become
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Silicon Valley</span> and housed in the three nameless
  floors later occupied by
  <span data-wiki="knight-ridder">Knight Ridder</span> following its purchase of
  Dialog Information Services. In the 1980's Memorex was purchased by RadioShack's parent company the Tandy Corporation
  and became widely known for its "shattered
  glass<sup>1</sup>" series of advertisements.

    <sup>1</sup>Groundbreaking segments featuring a notable and scantily-clad
    female singer breaking glass with her voice while being recorded on a
    Memorex consumer tape, followed by playback from the tape with an identical
    result. Aural injuries were reported by those on set for the filming of
    these commercials due to the playback of inaudible high and low frequency
    sound waves required to cause substantial vibration in the
    glass<sup>2</sup>, leading eventually to the narrowing of the recorded sonic
    spectrum in Memorex's consumer product line.

  <p>
    <sup>2</sup>Ironically Memorex in fact used their equipment to artificially
    alter and enhance the recorded sound, including the heavy equalization boost
    of high and low frequencies. It is reported that in the commercial series
    the initial vocal-based glass shattering was staged while the shattering via
    Memorex playback was authentic.
