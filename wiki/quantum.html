  <strong>Quantum Worldview [related: Quantum Mechanics, Quantum/Buddhist Worldview, Copenhagen Interpretation]</strong> 
  <br />
  Worldview positing quantum theory as, essentially, the mathematical representation of <span data-wiki="dharma">The Dharma</span>. As per the Copenhagen Interpretation, the Quantum Worldview (QW) paints reality as entirely observer dependent - an endless, causal sea of subjectivity absent of any external objective basis. Conceptual in nature, QW neither directly supports or contradicts <span data-wiki="simulation-theory">simulation theory</span>, the <span data-wiki="error">holographic principle</span>, and other related hypotheses. Most QW adherents approach base reality as essentially a <span data-wiki="error">black box cybernetic loop</span> - a shielded system whose central mechanism is, by its very nature, unknowable, leaving daylight for some kind of demiurgic figure, whether vindictive, benevolent, or simply aloof.
