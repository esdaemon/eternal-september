  <strong><em>The Decalogue</em> AKA <em>Dekalog</em> AKA <em>Dekalog: The Ten Commandments</em></strong> 
  <br />
  Polish made-for-TV film released in 1988 known for its egregious length, glacial pacing, and the maniacal fervor of its disciples<sup>1</sup>. Taking place entirely in a brutalist Polish public housing complex, the series is based somewhat indecipherably on the ten commandments as revealed to Moses at Mount Sinai<sup>3</sup>. <em>Dekalog</em> is often grouped Rainer Werner Fassbinder's <em><span data-wiki="weld-am-draht">Weld am Draht</span></em> as a notable (if aggressively abstract) commercial television series.
