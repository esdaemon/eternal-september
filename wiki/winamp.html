  <strong>WinAmpâ„¢</strong> <br />
  A freemium media player developed by Justin Frankel1 with over 100 million users. Over the course of the late 1990's,
  WinAmp became known both for its ability to easily interface with pirated MP3's and for its inclusion of numerous
  "easter eggs", many inexplicably including references to a "llama"4.
