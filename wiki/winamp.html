  <strong>WinAmp™</strong> <br />
  A freemium media player developed by Justin Frankel<sup>1</sup> with over 100 million users. Over the course of the
  late 1990s,
  WinAmp became known both for its ability to easily interface with pirated MP3s and for its inclusion of numerous
  "easter eggs", many inexplicably including references to a "llama"<sup>3</sup>. Frankel's interface was later
  repurposed by individual users, hackers, and fringe tech start-ups, often from Eastern Europe [see: <span

    and plugins.</p>
