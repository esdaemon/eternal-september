  <strong>Light Singing</strong> <br />
  Light Singing is the ritualistic practice of accessing <span data-wiki="dharma">The Emptiness</span> (or non-temporal,
  non-spatial reality) through
  the use of antediluvian sounds and gestures - antediluvian referring here to the time before the

  <span data-wiki="error">Great Flood</span>, an epic
  climatological catastrophe parrelled in virtually every major mythological system known to man. Light Singing is often associated with the <span data-wiki="enochian">Enochian</span> language or, more generally, the field of Enochian Magick. Channeling or
  mediumship is central to the practice of Light Singing, often resulting in the emergence of non-verbal or otherworldly
  sounds from the intermediary's larynx or chest cavity - sonorities often mistakenly labeled <span data-wiki="voynich-manuscript">glossolalia</span> - or, in
  common parlance, "speaking in tongues".
