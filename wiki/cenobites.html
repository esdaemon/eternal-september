  <strong>Cenobites [related: <em>Hellraiser</em>] </strong> 
  <br />
  A class of monks (most commonly <span data-wiki="error">Christian</span> or <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist</span>) known for the forming of "eremitic communities". Governed by a set of simple religious precepts, cenobites sever their contact with the outside world entirely and interact only with members of their sect or group. Due to their extreme isolation, cenobitic communities have been known to exhibit a "collective mental state<sup>1</sup>" - an inward facing spiraling mindmeld of delusion resulting, at times, in the perversion of their foundational beliefs. The term <em>cenobite</em> was appropriated for the Order of the Gash, a small league of extra-dimensional <span data-wiki="error">daemons</span> featured in Clive Barker's <em>Hellraiser</em> franchise of film and literature. Barker presents his Cenobites [re: capitalized] as morally ambiguous self-mutilating purveyors of the extreme no longer able to differentiate between pleasure and pain. The Order of the Gash is summoned by solving (intentionally or otherwise) the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box originally commissioned<sup>2</sup> by the pervy French aristocrat Duc de L'Isle in 1784.

  A schism in time/space opens. Slow dissolve to the realm of the Cenobites. Hell as a neverending Labyrinth…
