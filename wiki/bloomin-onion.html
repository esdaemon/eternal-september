  <strong>The Bloomin' Onion™</strong> 
  <br />
  An entree-sized appetizer composed of one large onion cut to resemble a flower, battered and then deep-fried, often served with a cream-based dipping sauce. The dish originated at the New Orleans-based restaurant Russell's Marina Grill, where it was originally The Onion Mum<sup>1</sup>. Outback Steakhouse founder Tim Gannon, a disgruntled former employee at Russell's Marina Grill, stole the recipe and created his own version, which he later sold at his Australian-themed<sup>2</sup> restaurant chain. Gannon subsequently changed the name of the dish to The Bloomin' Onion™ and trademarked it. Roy and Oliver St. John promptly sued Gannon for theft of the dish. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. The Bloomin' Onion™ is notable for its high caloric and fat content - a single serving contains almost 2500 calories. Upon its release, it became the most calorically dense single item on any menu in the United States, appetizer or otherwise, surpassing Wendy’s Triple <span data-wiki="baconator">Baconator</span>. Outback Steakhouse later introduced a territory-specific limited time only (LTO) variant of The Bloomin' Onion known colloquially as The Loaded Bloomin' Onion (LBO), a variation of the original Bloomin' Onion™ topped with generous portions of cheese, bacon, and sour cream.
