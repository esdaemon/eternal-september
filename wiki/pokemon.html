  <br />
  Created by <span data-wiki="error">Nintendo</span> in 1996,  Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise of substantial reach and fervent fandom. Satoshi Tajiri (AKA Dr. Bug), a technologist, amateur entomologist, and high school dropout, is widely credited for the original conception of the Pokémon universe. Tajiri first came to Nintendo's attention after publishing a privately distributed FanZine containing numerous video game "Easter Eggs1" - including game codes unbeknownst to the designers themselves. Despite achieving phenomenal financial success, especially considering the incoherent gameplay, Pokémon has long been the target of vitriol from various conservative groups. After spreading like strange wildfire through Middle American, Pokémon was accused by the <span data-wiki="error">Christian Family Research Council</span> (CFRC) of occultism. Of particular concern to them was the concept of "Pokémon Evolution", a creationist account in direct contradiction with the Bible<sup>3</sup>. In response, evangelist and entrepreneur David Tate released a morphed version of Pokémon entitled the Christian Power Cards in 1999<sup>4</sup>. Other issues raised by the CFRC and other conservative groups included the incorporation of a Nazi swastika into Koga's Ninja Trick<sup>5</sup> card and numerous depictions of established <span data-wiki="error">Freemason</span> and <span data-wiki="error">Illuminati</span> iconography. Efforts to stop the Pokémon spread were not limited to the West. Pokémon paraphernalia is currently illegal to purchase or sell in Saudi Arabia after authorities discovered <em>Colorless Energy</em>, a powerful and fundamental magical force, to be represented by the Zionist Star of David. Critics liberal and conservative alike have also taken issue with Pokémon's promotion of "regional exclusive" cards - limited edition items sometimes requiring international travel to complete sought after sets<sup>6</sup>. Anti-Pokémon sentiment peaked following the broadcast of <em>Dennō Senshi Porygon</em> or <em>Electric Soldier Porygon</em> (Season 1, Episode 38), a wildly abstract television episode staged entirely in cyberspace<sup>7</sup>. Aggressively peppered with repetitive, brightly colored visual effects, the show induced photosensitive epileptic seizures in over 1,000 Japanese children. An exposé followed exploring the Pokémon media franchise's efforts at mind control, possible in cooperation with the Japanese government. Nintendo's stock price fell almost 18% in the wake of the episode. Around a month after broadcast, the Pokémon division of Nintendo was concurrently served a class action lawsuit featuring over 800 plaintiffs and costly government-mandated audit of its finances and operations:  an avalanche of mishaps commonly referred to as the <span data-wiki="error">Pokémon Shock</span> incident. The franchise experienced further crisis upon the digital release of Lavender Town, a burial ground for deceased Pokémon. The location was renowned for its creepy and unnervingly dissonant soundtrack, giving rise to a rash of children's suicides throughout Japan - a phenomenon later dubbed <span data-wiki="error">Lavender Town Syndrome</span>.
