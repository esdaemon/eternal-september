  <strong>Ambien AKA Zolpidem [related: "Ambien Rain"]</strong>
  <br />
  A prescription-only Imidazopyridine (Z-drug) commonly used to regulate sleep cycles in insomniatic patients. Ambien
  users often develop feelings of deep attachment to the preternatural feeling
  of calm that accompanies their [effortless] descent into sleep state while on
  the drug. Amongst its numerous side effects is the common onset of "zombie
  behavior" including "sleep walking", "night eating", "night driving", and
  other somnambulistic behaviour, most notably the case of E___ McJ____
  [redacted], an 8-year-old boy who was given the medication and woke up eleven
  hours later inside of a window-mounted air conditioner. Users describe the
  onset of the medications' <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotic</span>-like
  effects as taking the form of a soft, warm rain.
