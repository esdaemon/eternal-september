  <strong>Knight Ridder<sup>1 </sup>[disambiguation:
    <span data-wiki="knight-rider">Knight Rider</span>]</strong>
  <br />
  Somewhat opaque media conglomerate with an extended history of technological
  development, often of indetermination purpose. Knight Ridder was the first
  news organization to experiment with
  <span data-wiki="videotex">videotex</span> upon its controversial purchase of
  <span data-wiki="viewtron">Viewtron Systems</span> in 1983, eventually
  shutting down the service in 1986. In 1988, the company sold its eight
  remaining television broadcast stations in order to purchase Dialog
  Information Services, a branch of Lockhead Corporation with no apparent
  function or assets. A decade later, after an extended period of inactivity and
  unprecedented opacity with its shareholders resulting in the plummet of its
  stock value, Ridder launched <em>Mercury News</em>, the world's first online
  news publication<sup>2</sup>. During this time period, the company operated
  from three unmarked floors in a downtown high-rise in modern day

  board<sup>3 </sup>launched a "strategic initiative" involving its immediate
  sale, despite a profit margin significantly larger than many Fortune 500
  corporations, including ExxonMobile, leading to speculation of board
  infiltration by its primary competitor,

    <sup>1</sup>The company is thought to be of partial Dutch origin. In
    evidence: "ridder" equates to "The Knight" in Dutch, strangely rendering the
    name of the company "Knight the Knight" in full translation, thus forming a
    word-based palindrome and reflecting the loop-based nature of many of its
    technological develops, many largely hidden from the general public via
    release as integrated embeds in existing platforms or discrete deep web
    links.

    <sup>2</sup>Knight Ridder board meetings were notoriously shrouded in
    secrecy, with each member represented by a shadow outline and remote audio
    feed in the company's pre-digital "digital conference room".

    <sup>3</sup>The <em>Mercury News</em> was notable for its aggressive
    investigation and subsequent debunking of the faulty rationale used for the
    <span data-wiki="tikrit">2003 invasion of Iraq</span> by the United States
    government. This coverage, though later widely praised throughout the
    journalistic world, damaged the financial prospects of the company by ending
    content generating contracts with many prominent media outlets, including
    traditional liberal establishments like <em>The New York Times</em>,
    <em>The Washington Post</em>, and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.
