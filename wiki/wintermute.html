  <strong><em>wintermute</em> [1986]</strong> <br />
  Despite the abstract setting and obscure vocabulary of <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span>'s
  <em>Neuromancer</em>, the novel's cult success spawned
  a handful of attempts at dramatization. All failed... mostly spectacularly <em>wintermute</em>, a spin-off television
  series
  launched in 1986 set entirely in an exorbitantly costly and brutally indecipherable analog rendition of cyberspace.
  Although the show managed to distill the novel's somewhat convoluted plot into a slightly more conventional tragic
  adventure story, it was marred by a lack of conventional action and forward momentum. <em>

  </em>, the series'
  pilot episode, contains multiple extended sequences of an unintentionally glitchy digital ocean, the longest of which
  spans over 1 minute and 23 seconds. Creator <span data-wiki="steven-bochco">Steven Bochco</span> later disavowed
  participation in the development of
  <em>wintermute</em> after Ohio Valley test viewings resulted in aggressively negative audience reactions including two
  separate
  [possibly unrelated/bogus] episodes of induced seizure<sup>1</sup>. The series was subsequently never aired. Despite
  the profound
  fiscal and dramatic failure of <em>wintermute</em>, the project helped solidify creator Steven Bochco's reputation as
  a
  visionary in the field of experimental entertainment television. Unusual for a network program, the progressive rock
  group Octagon of Dex<sup>2</sup> was hired to score the entirety of the series, including the show's now iconic
  opening credit
  sequence<sup>3</sup>. Following the untimely cancellation of <em>wintermute</em>, the group released material composed
  for the
  show as
  part of its debut (and only) commercially released album<sup>4</sup>.
