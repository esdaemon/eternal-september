  <strong>True Hunger AKA Real Hunger</strong>
  <br />
  Fifth stage of fasting marked by a feeling in the throat and/or mouth (as
  opposed to stomach). Feeding oneself to satisfy true hunger can not lead to
  weight gain or malnutrition as it is a biological signal to maintain proper
  body mass and nutrition. The experience of true hunger is said to at least
  temporarily eradicate all cravings associated with <span data-wiki="dharma">samsara</span> (mental grasping) and to purify and
  recalibrate the body's desire for biological and social/emotional nourishment.
  Subsequently, normal everyday hunger can be thought of as "toxic hunger", a
  state of body/mind that serves to perpetuate cycles of suffering based on the
  ongoing actualization of impure mental cravings.
