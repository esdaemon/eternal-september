  <strong>SkyNet Syndrome [related: <em>SKYNET SYNDROME</em> (television
    series)]</strong> <br />
  A theory developed by Dr. William Tiler Belt based on his "magnet of extinction" concept - the idea that capitalistic
  societies are destined to be reliant on processes of
  <!-- links to digital -->
  <span data-wiki="digital">digitization</span> and thus inextricably
  drawn to self destruction via the inevitable merger of governmental and corporate complexes into large conglomerate
  omnipotent power structures. Belt speculates that, in most cases, such societies would develop various forms of <span
    data-wiki="ai">AI</span>
  and nanotechnology in pursuit of
  greater and greater profit margins. These technologies would, in turn, be capable of causing mass human extinction. In
  Belt's model, the weaker the government, the stronger corporations, and vice versa - one always working in service of
  the other, forming a so-called MegaIndustrial Complex or MIC. Such MIC's are only counterbalanced by "shadow" outlaw
  organizations such as hacker networks, drug cartels, and militant civil rights organizations. The end drive of
  digitization in a capitalistic system is the development of self-replicating AI networks representing the ultimate in
  efficiency (and a complete absence of moral implication). Digitization, when viewed through the SkyNet Syndrome prism,
  includes the artificial divestment (in other words, abstraction) of material from its given causal continuum
  (<em>thus</em>
  becomes "this" and "that"), forming closed loops of destabilization and destruction. For example: the removal of coal
  from its indeginous ecological life cycle for use in the burning of fossil fuels, which in turn destabilizes and
  eventually destroys the ecosystems in which coal is naturally created. In most traditional, indigenous non-capitalist
  systems the end goal of society is sustainability through balance. This substratum of balance acts as a public and
  private directive, a system in which all individuals function within a larger environment as both the policers and the
  policed. Non-capitalist systems are thus marked by a centrifugal force towards the positive synthesis of opposing
  forces as opposed to their accentuation. The term SkyNet Syndrome is derived from the vindictive AI entity SkyNet as
  portrayed in the <em><span data-wiki="terminator">Terminator</span></em> series of films and television shows,
  including the eponymous

    programming montages. Additionally, the score for the series, created by the progressive rock ensemble <span
