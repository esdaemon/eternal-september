  <strong>Spectre Complex AKA Sceptre Complex<sup>Ω</sup></strong> 
  <br />
  Proto-digital mall developed by <span data-wiki="knight-ridder"></span>Knight Ridder and designed exclusively for use on the second generation of <span data-wiki="error">AT&T</span>'s Sceptre console. Sceptre Complex, as it was initially known, followed on the heels of the <span data-wiki="viewtron">Viewtron</span> system, layering skeletons of the previous <span data-wiki="videotex">Videotex</span> coding structure with updated (and often malformed) graphic skins to create the illusion of three dimensional space. This process, known as ray casting or billboarding<sup>1</sup>, was inspired by the original iteration of <span data-wiki="error">DOOM</span>, a hyper-violent gaming platform released by <span data-wiki="error">id</span> in 1993. The mall was navigable by user-generated conversable avatars - a functionality whose development reportedly swallowed over 80% of the project's overall budget.  As with Viewtron, the project was by any metric a failure, in part due to the commercial ineptitude of many of the mall's corporate tenets, a floundering cadre of enterprises including, but not limited to, <span data-wiki="radioshack">Radioshack</span>, <s>Bed, Bath, and</s> Beyond, and <span data-wiki="error">Abercrombie & Fitch</span>. Additionally, the mall featured what it referred to as "Ad Zones" - lightly interactive and often buggy graphic banners geared towards blatant promotion. Ad Zones were presented on a revolving basis and focused mainly on debut or limited time products, including McDonald's Shrimp McBites™, <span data-wiki="error">Diet 'Zona Honey Ginseng</span> tea, Abercrombie's overpriced luxury perfume Cerulean Mist, and the IROC Z sports car<sup>2</sup>. By the time of Knight Ridder's dissolution in the late 1990's, the Spectre Complex had for all intents and purposes been abdicated. However, the platform's functionality<sup>3</sup> proved attractive to hackers, as did Videotex's veritable sieve of a security system. The mall was subsequently squatted, experiencing a "<span data-wiki="error">pink twilight</span>" of unofficial and unsanctioned use. This transition was signified by the neologistic respelling of the mall's forename as "Spectre" by its new inhabitants.
