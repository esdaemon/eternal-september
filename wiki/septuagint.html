  <strong>Septuagint [related: King James Version of the Bible, Ptomely II
    Philadelphia]</strong>
  <br />
  The premiere extant translation of biblical passages and accompanying texts
  (including various

  the year 300 BCE, forming a
  <!-- links to codex gigas -->
  <span data-wiki="error">CODEX</span> including by
  not limited to what is now known as the Old Testament. As detailed in a pseudo
  biographical letter from Aristeas to his brother Philocrates<sup>2</sup>, the
  Septuagint originated in a request by Ptomely II
  <span data-wiki="eraserhead">Philadelphia</span><sup>1</sup> for seventy-two Jewish
  scholars translate the Jewish Torah from Hebrew for the Library of Alexandria,
  a process also outlined in detail by
  <!-- links to St. Augustine -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Augustine of Hippo</span>. The Septuagint was
  effectively (and problematically) rendered obsolete by the development of the
  King James Version<sup>2</sup> of the bible published in 1611, despite
  confirmed reports that King James directed translators (who were only
  moderately familiar with Koine Greek) to orient the text around full support
  of a Bishop-led hierarchy, removing numerous mentions of meditation,
  mindfulness, and non-dualism. The KJV, as it is commonly known, also
  frequently and aggressively delineates a binary between miracle and magick,
  thus leading to the widespread and ongoing persecution of Paganism in all its
  various forms, including, by extension, the Salem Witch Hunt.

    <sup>2</sup>Although the exact translators of the KJV remain unknown, it is
    now widely speculated that William Shakespeare was, at minimum, a
    participant, as evidence by "Psalm 46" - the inexplicable aggregate
    appearance of Shakespeare's name via the combination of every 46th word of
    the 46th Psalm. In support: KJV of the bible was completed and prepped for
    publication in 1610, the year Shakespeare turned 46.
