  <strong>Event Horizon</strong>
  <br />
  A circumferential plane surrounding a hyper-dense area (i.e., a singularity<sup>1</sup>) past which objects and/or
  information cannot escape<sup>2</sup>. Seen through the lens of the "<span data-wiki="error">black hole information
    paradox</span>", event horizons are simply infinite fields of information dislodged from their original source,
  suspended in time for all of eternity. Scientists posit that observers passing through a sufficiently massive black
  hole's event horizon are given a choice - surrender to the infinitude of frozen information or experience the
  excruciating spaghettification of reality. Though virtually all black hole event horizons would appear colorless to
  the naked eye - it has become standard in composite photos to portray them as a stunning ring of turquoise.

  <p><sup>1</sup>When reality folds in on itself. When, in a moment, memory is so imprinted as to then reorient every
    moment following around it. To arrange each future possibility, realized or unrealized, solely by its proximity to
    that singular moment - in grotto or on beach. </p>
  <p><sup>2</sup>It should be noted that the "black hole event horizon" concept, as commonly understood and represented,
    is teleological in nature, and therefore fundamentally theoretical. Systems able to circumvent this paradox are in
    development and include, notably, <span data-wiki="error">quantum loop gravity</span>. </p>
