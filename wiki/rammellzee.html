  <strong>Rammellzee AKA RAMM:ΣLL:ZΣΣ [December 15, 1960 - June 28, 2010][related: Five-Percent-Nation, Supreme Mathematics]</strong> 
  <br />
  A NY-based gothic futuristic hip-hop artist, opera composer, art theoretician, sculptor, and graffiti writer. Ramm, as he was known colloquially, was a prominent member of the Five-Percent-Nation, also known as the Nation of Gods and Earth (NGE), a Black Nationalist organization founded in 1964 by Allah the Father, formerly known as Clarence 13X. Despite the organization's numerous acts of goodwill and community service, it was targeted as a terrorist organization by the <span data-wiki="error">FBI</span> in the late 1960's as part of the <span data-wiki="error">COINTELPRO</span> initiative, leading to a period of discreditation and controversy. The NGE's highly advanced system of Supreme Mathematics, developed in secret by Allah the Father, uniquely attributes both qualitative <em>and</em> quantitative values to numbers<sup>1</sup>. The method by which Allah the Father derived these values were derived remains a mystery.

  <p><sup>1</sup>Due to the impenetrability of the system's <span data-wiki="error">codex</span>, Supreme Mathematics were thought by the FBI to be a tool for the covert communication of scientific and military data.</p>
