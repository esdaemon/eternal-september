  <strong>Andrei Tarkovsky [Apr. 4, 1932 - Dec. 29, 1986] [see also: <em>Stalker, Solaris</em>] [<em>related: Nostalghia, The Sacrifice</em>]</strong> 
  <br />
  Sculptor of time [filmmaker] and documentarian of dreams [poet], the Russian artist Andrei Tarkovsky spent decades wrestling with the fundamentally ungraspable. The seven films of his <em>oeuvre</em> attempt poetic dialogue with what is irrevocably in-between or just beyond reach. Consequently, Tarkovsky's work is marked by a fascination with alien life [<em><span data-wiki="solaris">Solaris</span></em>], the otherwise supernatural, the occult<sup>1</sup>, and the shrouded nature of deep desire [<em><span data-wiki="stalker">Stalker</span></em>]. A true mystic, Tarkvosky held great reverence for mythological systems, not for their symbology, but for their concrete ability to interact with the <span data-wiki="error">Emptiness</span>. Whether through widespread climatological disaster or impending nuclear holocaust, Tarkovsky often used the apocalypse as a McGuffin, presenting strange ritual as its antidote. In <em>The Sacrifice</em>, the film's central protagonist copulates with a witch while levitating to end World War III. And at the conclusion of <em>Nostalghia</em>, an aimless poet must walk the entire length of an empty mineral bath with an unextinguished candle to prevent the end of the world. The poet's journey lasts a full 17-and-a half-minutes and is filmed in a single shot<sup>2</sup>.

  <p><sup>2</sup>Chronologically speaking, his films feature scenes of increasingly brutal duration, limited action, slow-pacing, meticulous framing, and sparse/strange musical scoring. </p>
