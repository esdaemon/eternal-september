  <strong>Enochian [related: Enoch, Enochian Magick, Antediluvian, John Dee, Sir
    Edward Kelly]</strong>
  <br />
  Developed by the Anglo-Welsh mathematician and alchemist John Dee and his
  colleague Sir Edward Kelly in 16th Century England, Enochian is an occult or
  angelic language used in the practice of Enochian Magic. The language was
  revealed to the men by the Enochian angels, recorded in private journals and
  was claimed by them to be originally used by Adam and his direct progeny to
  name all material things. In this sense, Enochian can be seen as being
  antediluvian<sup>1</sup>. Via use of the Enochian language direct
  communication with angelic beings is possible - of particular value as such
  entities are not subject to the standard limitations of space and time. The
  term Enochian is derived from <span data-wiki="enochian">Enoch</a> (aka
