  <strong>Pazuzu</strong> <br />
  The king demon of the wind in <span data-wiki="error">Assyrian</span> and <span data-wiki="error">Mesopotamian</span> culture, Pazuzu is depicted as having the body of a man, the head of a lion or dog, talons of an eagle, two pairs of wings, a scorpion's tail and a serpentine penis. Pazuzu is most often shown with his right hand up and left hand down and was characterized in the <span data-wiki="lesser-key-of-solomon">Grimoire of Solomon</span> as possessing both positive and negative traits. Failure to appease Pazuzu results in famine and locust swarms. The demon's snake-like coiled phallus is seen by many biblical scholars as relating to the <span data-wiki="error">Exile from Paradise</span>. In simplest terms, Pazuzu is <em>necessary</em> evil -  the spirit of evil charged with driving other more destructive forces<sup>1</sup> away.
