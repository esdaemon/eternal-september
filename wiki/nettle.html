  <strong>Nettle AKA Stinging Nettle</strong> <br />
  Or <em>urtica dioca</em>: a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia and North Africa. Nettle is remarkable
  for both
  its high protein content and its stinging hairs (trichomes) which are known to cause <em>

    <span data-wiki="error">paresthesia</span>
  </em>. It is this latter
  quality that led to its use by the Saxons as a means of staying "mindful" during the psychological exploration of
  repressed memories, a practice later explored in considerably more depth by
  <span data-wiki="imago">Sigmund
    Freud</span> and his myrmidons. Nettle
  was originally thought to have been brought to modern day England via the Romans, but in 2011 a burial cist dating
  from around 1650 BC was uncovered on Whitehorse Hill in Dartmoor containing a ceremonial sash made from stinging
  nettle.
