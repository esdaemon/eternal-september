  <strong>Apocrypha AKA Biblical Apocrypha [related: <em>Book of Revelations</em>]</strong> 
  <br />
  Within <span data-wiki="error">Christian</span> theology, the term apocrypha refers to a set of biblical texts of unknown or unverifiable provenance<sup>1</sup> included within the <span data-wiki="septuaguint">Septuagint</span> considered deuterocanonical by some traditional Greek Catholic sects but illegitimate by Protestants. The bizarre and violent <em><span data-wiki="error">Book of Revelations</span></em>, the terminal book of the New Testament, was widely considered to be apocryphal until its revision and subsequent inclusion in the <span data-wiki="error">King James Version of the Bible</span> (KJV). Much apocrypha deals with metaphysical issues (often via the lens of phenomenology) and stands in accordance with standard <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist</span> worldviews. As a means of discrediting apocryphal biblical texts, post-medieval clergymen known as the <span data-wiki="error">Church Fathers</span>, in coordination with the British Monarchy, engaged in a shadow campaign to imbue the term <em>apocrypha</em> with a sense of illegitimacy, inaccuracy, and error<sup>2</sup>. Their efforts led to the coalescence of <span data-wiki="error">Gnosticism</span>, a religious movement based in part on the continued incorporation of apocryphal texts including, but not limited to, <em><span data-wiki="error">The Book of Enoch</span></em>, <em><span data-wiki="error">Testament of Solomon</span></em>, <em><span data-wiki="codex">Sophia of the Christ</span></em>, and <em><span data-wiki="apocrypha">Apocryphon of John the Apostle</span></em>. The term apocrypha is now commonly used beyond the bounds of Christian in reference to illegitimate documents of unknown authorship and/or doubtful origin.
