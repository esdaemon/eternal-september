  <strong><em>Solomon's Key</em> [Tecmo, 1986][related: Michiharu Hasuya]</strong>
  <br />
  A 1987 <span data-wiki="nes">NES</span> title in which a Taoist Monk<sup>1</sup>

  urban legends surrounding various unexplained and unsubstantiated spectral and
  metaphysical phenomena associated with Level 50. Music by Michiharu
