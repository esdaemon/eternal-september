  <strong>MindVox [related: Dead Lord, Lord Digital]</strong> <br />
  A legendary and controversial early Internet Service Provider (ISP) in New
  York City, founded in 1991 by Dead Lord and
  <span data-wiki="lord-digital">Lord Digital</span>, former members of the
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Legion of Doom</span> hacking group. Mindvox was
  launched via a Bulletin Board test message posted by the infamous hacker
  <span data-wiki="phiber-optik">Phiber Optik</span> of the
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Masters of Deception</span> while waiting for a
  Manhattan Grand Jury Indictment. The initial opening of Mindvox as a public
  ISP was announced via the essay "Voices in My Head" by Lord Digital, outlining
  his vision for cyberspace (a term coined by novelist and poet
  <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span>) and detailing his experience as
  both hacker and <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics </span>addict. The
  service was riddled with in-jokes (often profane) and intentional obfuscation,
  eventually folding due to the instability of its leadership structure, despite
  lucrative buyout offers from both
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span> and
  Viacom, although rumors of a continuing deep web invitation only "shadow service"
  continue to this day (perhaps speaking to a "
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">pink twilight</span>
  ".). While active, MindVox was a digital locus point for discussions on
  various forms of harm reduction including drug legalization and LGBT rights
  and notable for its role in the dissemination of
  <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span>'s
  <em>Agrippa</em> in 1992 via staged "leak". The
  adherence to cyberpunk aesthetics and values throughout MindVox's existence
  stands in stark contrast to the concurrent emerging greed and corporatization
  of various
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Silicon Valley</span> companies, even those
  launched by former hackers and techno-activists.
