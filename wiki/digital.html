  <strong>Digital AKA Digitization</strong> 
  <br />
  The process of artificially converting information that is in a casual or fluid state of wholeness via into a system of binary numbers, thus discretely divesting it from its source. Early digital devices included the abacus, a tool for complex calculation generally thought to have been developed by ancient <span data-wiki="error">Babylonians</span>. Beginning in the mid-20th-century, the drive towards digitalization was largely the result of technologies developed by <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span>, including torpedo control systems, digital speech scrambling circa World War II, and the first digital art application in 1962<sup>1</sup>. By 1999, more information was stored in digital than analog form. Although spiritual leaders, especially those following some form of <span data-wiki="dharma">the Dharma</span>, often liken digitization to a virus of meaningless - a turn away from fundamental reality further plunging humanity into a funhouse world of construct and abstract concept, there do exist in the physical world digital corollaries. In fact, the <span data-wiki="error">black hole information paradox</span>/<span data-wiki="error">holographic universe</span> model posits that the world itself is simply a two-dimensional plane of information giving rise to the illusion of dimensionality. In more basic terms, DNA is itself a digital system, lending credence to the claims that our biological reality is, if not a <span data-wiki="error">simulation</span>, certainly designed and generated in a manor far advanced of but similar to rudimentary cyberspace.
