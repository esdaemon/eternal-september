  <strong>Black Drop [related: Ashen Light]</strong>
  <br />
  The term black drop refers to an unexplained optical phenomenon involving the passing of Venus [female] in front of
  the sun [male].

<p><em>
    "I afterwards observed that immediately around the planet [re: Venus] there was a dusky tinge, making it appear as
    if it had sunk below the sun's surface. The entire scene bore the quality of two not three dimensions."
  </em></p>
<p>
  The standard (if unsatisfying) explanation of black drop centers on equipment malfunction. Black drop is often seen as
  relating to "ashen light", another unexplained phenomena associated with <span data-wiki="venusian-enigmata">Venusian
    Enigmata</span>: a subtle blue/green/grey glow emanating from the "dark side" of the planet. Initially, ashen light
  was attributed to lightning storms on the planet's telescopically unviewable side. However, Japan's Akatsuki probe was
  recently injected into Venus' orbit for 30 days, finding zero instances of visible lightning. Astrophysicists now
  posit ashen light to be a physiological disturbance in the mind of the observer<sup>1</sup>.
