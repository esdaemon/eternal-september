  <br />
  Austrian
  <!-- all links to "serialism" *ready* -->
  <span data-wiki="error">serialist</span> composer and member of the
  <span data-wiki="error">Second Viennese School</span> (SVS) along with Arnold
  Schoenberg (Berg's mentor),
  <span data-wiki="anton-webern">Anton Webern</span>, and, intermittently,
  <span data-wiki="karlheinz-stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</span>. Berg's
  work is notable within the SVS for its overt romanticism, flaunting of strict
  adherence to serialism's "

  <span data-wiki="colonel-john-matrix">matrix</span> dogma", and
  the extensive incorporation of cyphertext and messaging, most notably in his 
  <span data-wiki="lyric-suite">Lyric Suite</span>. Berg's early life was inauspicious
  - he was forced to repeat both sixth and seventh grade, and at the age of
  sixteen fathered a child with Marie Scheuchl, a maid in a neighboring estate
  fifteen years his senior. It was around this time he began studies with
  Schoenberg despite possessing no formal musical education. He went on to
  produce the heralded Lyric Suite and perhaps the two most notable operatic
  works of the 20th Century, Wozzeck and Lulu, the latter of which was finished
  posthumously1 and centers around a manipulative and seductive prostitute who
  is brutally murdered by Jack the Ripper. Berg fell out of favor with the Nazi
  regeim towards the end of his life despite widely spread accusations that
  serialism doubled as a a cypher system used by the axis powers to smuggled
  scientific information relating to the development of advanced atomic
  weaponry.
