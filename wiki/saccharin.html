  <strong>Saccharin</strong> 
  <br />
  A metallic tasting chemical food additive approximately 300-400 times sweeter than sugar. Prior to its widespread discontinuation<sup>1</sup> in the 1990's, saccharin was used to sweeten no calorie drinks such as Tab, Diet Dr. Pepper, and <span data-wiki="error">Crystal Pepsi</span>. A heat-stable substance, saccharin does not react to other ingredients and is essentially non-perishable. As such, water tables around saccharin manufacturing plants and distribution centers have been found to contain high quantities of the chemical. Moreover, bees like it.
