  Arguably the first end-user information system, videotex was launched in the
  late 1970's using a computer-like format to display text on a "dumb terminal".
  In contrast to the later developed "

  <span data-wiki="error">internet</span>",
  videotex was almost entirely centralized with minimal userâ†’ server
  communication. In later years, videotex became a "generic trademark" and was
  used to refer to a variety of text information systems including bulletin
  boards and flight information displays at airports. By the late 1980's
  videotex's usage was limited to a few niche applications (most associated
  North American and European military alliances) aside from Minitel<sup>1</sup>
  users in France.

    <sup>1</sup>A videotex service that oddly logged over 10 million unique
    users in 1999 despite few documented subscribers, Minitel pioneered the use
    of a "computer-like interface" for purchase of train/airline tickets, shared
    calendars, and dating applications. It is speculated that, following the
    advent of The Internet, Minitel was used primarily by French male citizens
    for the sending and receiving of so-called "<!-- links to pink twilight --><span data-wiki="error">pink messages</span>" via difficult to access
    dialogue channels. Previous to its dissolution,
    Minitel still maintained approximately $60 million in annual revenue.
