  <strong>Narcotics [related: Narcissus, Nepenthe]</strong>
  <br />
  Any psychoactive compound known to induce sleepiness, forgetfulness, sometimes
  accompanied by mild euphoria<sup>1. </sup>The term was originally taken from
  narcissus, a narcotic known to induce
  trance-like states and hallucinations, leading to the etymology of the term
  "narcissism<sup>2</sup>" after the myth of an intoxicated youth that drowned
  after falling in love with his own reflection in a shallow pool of fetid
  water. The term "narcotic" was later also applied to nepenthe
  <sup>3</sup>, a narcotic of unknown origin described at length in the
  writings of ancient Greece.

    <sup>1</sup>Debate continues to surround the "source" of narcotic-induced
    euphoria, with some experts attributing the occasional appearance of
    euphoria in narcotic users to temporary freedom from the
    <span data-wiki="error">Labyrinth</span> via loss of discrete "self" (as
    opposed to acute chemo-neurological processes in the brain).

    <sup>2</sup>It should be noted that severe (often impermanent) narcissism
    often accompanies the onset of
    <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenic</span> and/or non-specific
    psychotic episodes, a commonality that, according to Buddhist doctrine, can
    be attributed to the ailing mind being entirely pervaded by an errant sense
    of discrete, inherently existing "self".

    <sup>3</sup>Nepenthe, a genus of carnivorous plant found throughout the Old
    World tropics, was later named after the mythical drug, in part based on its
    technique of intoxicating small lizards and other reptiles into submission
    and then drowning them in dew-filled monkey cups.
