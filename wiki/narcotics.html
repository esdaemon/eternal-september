  <strong>Narcotics [related: Narcissus, Nepenthe, Narc][disambiguation: <em>My Nepenthe</em>]</strong>
  <br />
  A specific set of psychoactive compounds known to induce forgetfulness and mild euphoria<sup>1</sup>, though the term
  was also later applied to nepenthe, a substance of unknown origin described at length in the writings of ancient
  Greece. Although the ubiquity of narcotics in the Western World declined after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the
  1980's saw an explosion of <span data-wiki="error">cocaine</span>-based narcotic use in the United States. Television
  producer <span data-wiki="steven-bochco">Steven Bochco</span>, an amateur scholar of antiquities, noticed parallels
  between the ancient and modern worlds, giving rise to the television series <span data-wiki="my-nepenthe">My
    Nepenthe</span>. The term "narcotic" was originally taken from narcissus<sup>2</sup>, a plant known to induce
  trance-like states and hallucinations, leading to the etymology of the term "narcissism<sup>3</sup>" after the myth of
  an intoxicated youth that drowned after falling in love with his own reflection in a shallow pool of fetid water.
  Throughout history, narcotics and other psychotropic drugs have played a central role in mythologically-based mystical
  practices including astral projection and levitation. Although they have been categorized by the United States
  government as extremely harmful and problematically addictive, various medical scholars, most notably <span
    data-wiki="imago">Sigmund Freud</span>, have enthusiastically prescribed and ingested narcotics in various forms.

    <sup>1</sup>Debate continues to surround the "source" of narcotic-induced
    euphoria, with some experts attributing the occasional appearance of
    euphoria in narcotic users to temporary freedom from the
    <span data-wiki="error">Labyrinth</span> via loss of discrete "self" (as
    opposed to acute chemo-neurological processes in the brain).

    <sup>2</sup>A genus of carnivorous plant found throughout the Old World tropics, was later named after the mythical
    drug, in part based on its technique of intoxicating small lizards and other reptiles into submission and then
    drowning them in dew-filled monkey cups.

    <sup>3</sup>It should be noted that severe (often impermanent) narcissism
    often accompanies the onset of
    <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenic</span> and/or non-specific
    psychotic episodes, a commonality that, according to <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist</span> doctrine, can
    be attributed to the ailing mind being entirely pervaded by an errant sense
    of discrete, inherently existing "<span data-wiki="the-self">self</span>".
