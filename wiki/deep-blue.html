  <strong>Deep Blue</strong>
  <br />
  Rudimentary <span data-wiki="ai">A.I.</span> (artificial intelligence)
  designed by I.B.M. Deep Blue became the first computational system to defeat a
  reigning world chess champion on Feb. 10, 1996, with its controversial win
  over Gary Kasparov. Following the match, Kasparov accused I.B.M. of
  maleficence and illegal human manipulation<sup>1</sup>, demanding a rematch.
  The company refused, offering no official retort to Kasparov's accusations and
  promptly dismantled the machine. Deep Blue is the most notorious amongst a
  long line of chess faux-automatons beginning with The Turk, an 18th Century
  invention constructed by Wolfgang von Kempelen to impress Maria Theresa, an
  Austrian Empress. When controlled by a skilled operator, the Turk became a
  formidable opponent, defeating a number of prominent players, including the
  heralded statesmen Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The shell of the
  machine was later purchased and displayed by Johann Nepomuk MÃ¤lzel, though the
  exact nature and functioning of Kempelen's original mechanism remains unknown.

    <sup>1</sup>Strangely the "human manipulation" appears to have been in the
    form of mid-game nonsensical interjections into Deep Blue's methodical
    strategy (i.e. "mistakes"). These instances of aberration led Kasparov to
    adopt preemptively defensive postures sacrificing momentum he had built
    earlier in the game.
