  <strong>Panopticon</strong> 
  <br />
  Designed in the 18th-century by British philosopher Jeremy Bentham, the founder of modern utilitarianism, a panopticon is a combo physical structure/control system based on the concept of induced paranoia<sup>1</sup>. Occupants of a panopticon are positioned in such a way as to be unable to tell if they are being watched. The term was traditionally most associated with Bentham's controversial prison design in which a towering concrete octagon of cells opens inward to a circular raised guard station encased in tinted glass<sup>2</sup>. However, throughout the 1980's, the term was adapted by many philosophers and social theorists to describe the disquieting onset of digital surveillance culture as employed by the <span data-wiki="error">CIA</span>, <span data-wiki="error">FBI</span>, and large techno-communications conglomerates like <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span>.
