  <strong>Emergent Hyper-structural Portal Functionality AKA EHSPF [related:
    MetroidVania]</strong>
  <br />
  Emergent Hyper-structural Portal Functionality or EHSPF (of which
  <span data-wiki="vpd">VPD</span>'s are a subset) refers to various
  permutations of functional portals offering veiled or shielded glimpses of or
  contact with the Hidden World AKA the contents of the
  <span data-wiki="cybernetics">Black Box</span> by articulating a poignant and
  enveloping alternate reality. Most often EHSPF is used in reference to digital
  alternate reality platforms (<span data-wiki="error">VPD</span>'s) containing a palpable aesthetic of
  loneliness, desolation, and longing. The concept emerged in part as a way to parse the
  emotional and psychological effects of the MetroidVania<sup>1</sup> series of
  games originally associated with the Nintendo Entertainment System (<span data-wiki="nes">NES</span>). Primarily
  centering on <span data-wiki="metroid">Metroid</span>,
  <span data-wiki="zelda">The Legend of Zelda, </span>and a number of titles
  from <span data-wiki="konami">Konami</span> and, to a lesser extent, Capcom,
  the series was characterized by the insinuation of a world beyond view via
  scrolling - elements that pre-exist (and post-exist) engagement. Thus, the
  player itself controls the scrolling, the view of the game orients a limitless
  reality around <em>self</em>. This conjuring or insinuation of the
  non-temporal non-spatial aspects of
  cyberspace led to direct engagement with
  <span data-wiki="apeirophobia">apeirophobia</span>, or fear/fascination with infinity as it pertains to the
  generation of so-called existential (and thus poignant) emotions. These
  emotions result in the digital reality taking on the properties of a
  simulacrum. Extreme examples of this technique include various "infinite loop"
  traps from the EHSPF series including, but not limited to, the

  <span data-wiki="error">Ladder Scene</span> in
  <em><span data-wiki="metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</span> 3: Snake Eater</em>. Also vital in the parsing of EHSPF
  functionality is gameplay based on non-linear, self determination and
  cybernetic self-advancement via the acquisition of skills and weapons and need
  to backtrack. The practice of reality morphing/glitches<sup>2</sup> (whether
  or not intentional) as it relates to
  <!-- links to self  -->
  <span data-wiki="berhold-brecht">Brecht</span>'s
  <em>Verfremdungseffekt </em>or "distancing effect" also serves to amplify
  emotional effects of the EHSPF series. By reinforcing the digital artifice
  inherent to such environments, players are made aware that they are inhabiting
  a parallel reality. Sometimes referred to as "glitch framing", these transparencies of machinery parallel "IRL"
  moments of contact or awareness with base reality characterized by the transcendence of cerebral conceptual frameworks
  including a discrete sense of self. Subsequently, EHSPF terminology has come to be applied to the non-digital realm.

  <span data-wiki="ornithomancy">ornithological</span> bird behaviours<sup>3</sup>â€“these non-digital phenomena have been cited
  as having potential ESHPF properties (especially when paired with the appropriate audio)<sup>4</sup>. Additionally,
  portal functionality can be accessed
  internally via extended meditation, psychosis, and/or psychedelic/<span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotic</span>
  drugs. Hyper-structurality here refers to the emergence of portal
  functionality from larger systems of interlocking alternate reality generators with
  common practices, phenomenological parameters, and general aesthetic sense<sup>5</sup>. In recent years, a number of
  prominent neuropsychologists have begun to posit the idea that the public's unquenchable desire for items displaying
  ESHPF actually represents a turn away from base reality, and that our pursuit of such portals amounts to a sort of
  <span data-wiki="imago">Freudian</span> "death wish" in the form of a non-temporal nostalgic oblivion.
