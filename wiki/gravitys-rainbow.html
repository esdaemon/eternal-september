  complex work features a remarkable fluidity between scientific research and
  speculative metaphysics, much of it centering around the implications of

  positive reviews<sup>1</sup> and inclusion in various collegiate syllabi, the
  book was scientifically proven to be impenetrable and Pynchon was found to
  have employed various techniques of aleatory in its construction including the
  <em>I, Ching</em>, dice rolling, and indeterminate computational algorithms.

    <sup>1</sup>The book was selected for recognition by the Pulitzer Prize
    fiction jury in 1974, but the organization's advisory board found Pynchon's
    work to be "turgid" and "obscene" - a "veritable intellectual hoax" . As a
    result of the standoff, no prize for fiction was awarded that year.
