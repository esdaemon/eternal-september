  <strong><em>Dallas</em> [CBS, 1978-1991]</strong>
  <br />
  Series known primarily for its sweeping opening sequence featuring dramatic
  aerial shots, desaturated cityscapes, and rolling frame editing. Due to its
  late time slot (9pm) and adult subject matter (showers,
  J.R., et al) the episodic content often
  remained obscure and is largely forgotten.
