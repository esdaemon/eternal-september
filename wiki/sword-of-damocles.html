  <strong>The Sword of Damocles AKA The Virtual Sword of Damocles [related: Ivan Sutherland, Vannevar Bush, DARPA, ARL,
    HMD]</strong>
  <br />
  The Sword of Damocles Computer Science Project (SDCSP) was a virtual reality-based research project featuring the
  world's first Head Mounted Display (HMD). Debuting in 1960, the SDCSP precursed the eventual development of functional
  VR technology by almost 40 years. ​​The project was led by Ivan Sutherland<sup>1</sup>, creator of the SketchPad™, and
  his team of researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Sutherland's system involved an
  ingenious combination of rudimentary computer graphics, stereoscopic lensing, hand-sautered electronics, plastic
  tubing and cosmetic mirrors - along with specially-made sensor gloves<sup>2</sup> to track the user's movements.
  Following the unveiling of its initial prototype, the SDCSP received seed funding from the Defense Advanced Research
  Projects Agency (DARPA) and, later, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) under contract with <span
    data-wiki="error">Bell Helicopter</span> for use in aerial weaponry development and aviation training.

  Due to the low processing power available at the time, the computational control system used by Sutherland's team was
  gargantuan, weighing over 3,500 pounds - roughly equivalent to half the helicopter on which it was to be housed.
  Occupying over 500 square feet, the SDCSP's central controls generated temperatures upwards of 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
  The project's military participants were subjected to a variety of grueling simulations, including helicopter and
  airplane crashes, shipwrecks, and other disasters - resulting in waves of nausea and heat stroke. The project made
  significant progress until it was eventually shut down in 1974 after a slew of technical difficulties and participant
  complaints/threatened litigation. Overall, the SOD was estimated by <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span> to have
  cost approximately $52 million and was, at the time of its discontinuation, widely considered to be a failure. The
  SDCSP was somewhat satirically named after a <span data-wiki="error">Greek myth</span> in which the (likely
  apocryphal) miscreant Damocles was briefly seated on the throne of Dionysius only to find a heavy sword strung
  gingerly above his head - an analogous reference to the bulky and extremely ponderous equipment employed in
  Sutherland's HMD.

    <sup>3</sup>An American inventor known primarily for role in the <span data-wiki="error">Manhattan project</span>
    alongside the mystic physicist <span data-wiki="error">Robert Oppenhiemer</span>. Bush's 1945 essay "As We May
    Think"<sup>5</sup> foreshadowed the development of both virtual reality and the lexicographical aspects of the
    internet (and the subsequent wave of information overload4). Regarding the former, Bush claimed:
  </p>
  <p class="pointfive"><em>
      "The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the very existence of
      matter. Atom by atom. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such
      a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be, if fired, fatal."
    </em></p>

    <sup>4</sup>Sutherland credited Bush's fictional (and comically complex) Memex device for the Sketchpad™'s initial
    conception.<br />
    <sup>5</sup>A term that Bush, in fact, coined.
