  <strong>Hatra</strong> <br />
  An ancient Mesopotamian city approximately 180 miles northwest of Baghdad, Iraq. Occupying a liminal space between the
  Roman and Persian empires, Hatra was abandoned after being ransacked in the 3rd century - its stunning ruins were
  discovered by nomadic herders in the mid-1800's. Hatra was featured as the opening location in <em>

  </em>, leading
  directly to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Subsequently, the area underwent a recklessly costly
  restoration at the hands of

  his name (a practice in
  purposeful emulation of

  <span data-wiki="error">Nebuchadnezzar</span>). Having since taken control of the area, the
  Islamic State of Iraq and the
  Levant (aka Daesh) plan to raze the Ruins of Hatra, claiming its artifacts encourage polytheism. Robust income via
  "horror-porn" tourism has thus far prevented the group from actionalizing their threat.
