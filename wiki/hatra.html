  <strong>Hatra</strong> <br />
  An ancient <span data-wiki="error">Mesopotamian</span> caravan city approximately 180 miles northwest of Baghdad, Iraq. Occupying a liminal space between the Roman and Persian empires, Hatra was abandoned after being ransacked in the 3rd century - its stunning ruins were
  discovered by nomadic herders in the mid-1800's. Hatra was featured as the opening location in <em><span data-wiki="the-exorcist">The Exorcist</span>
  </em>, leading
  directly to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Subsequently, the area underwent a recklessly costly
  restoration at the hands of
  <!-- links to Ba'athism [related: Sadam Hussein] -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Sadam Hussien</span> - he demanded each brick be monogrammed with his name (a practice in purposeful emulation of
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Nebuchadnezzar</span>). Having since taken control of the area, the
  Islamic State of Iraq and the
  Levant (aka Daesh) plans to raze the Ruins of Hatra, claiming its artifacts encourage polytheism. Robust income via
  "horror-porn" tourism has thus far prevented the group from actionalizing their threat. Hatra is known in Muslim and Judeo-Christian texts as the origin place of <span data-wiki="pazuzu">Pazuzu</span>, <em>The Exorcist</em>'s central antagonist.
