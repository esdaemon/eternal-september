  <strong>Simulation Theory [related: The Labyrinth]</strong> 
  <br />
  Many scientists now postulate that reality itself is in fact a Simulation, a mirror of a mirror...<em>of a mirror</em><sup><strong><span data-wiki="error">Ω</span></strong></sup><!--LINK TO INTO THE TURQUOISE DIGITAL RIPTIDE-->, a hypothesis supported by <span data-wiki="quantum-loop-gravity">Quantum Loop Gravity</span> - a theory claiming spacetime itself to be pixelated<sup>1</sup> like a computer monitor or a television screen. Supporters of Simulation Theory point to the inextricable emotional interwebbing of digital and physical reality in support of their argument. In fact, it has become common for the users of <span data-wiki="vpd">Virtual Portal Devices</span> to develop strong emotional (even sexual) connections with their digital selves, or avatars<sup>2</sup>. Scientific studies, including the work of <span data-wiki="microsoft">Donald Hoffman</span>, point towards our perceptual system as limiting graphic interface - functionally, a representational means of navigation absent of any direct relationship with objective reality. Hoffman's vantage point both contradicts and supports the <span data-wiki="quantum">Quantum/Buddhist worldview</span>, with core reality (<span data-wiki="dharma">the Emptiness</span>) knowable experientially but not conceptually in any kind of direct manner. However, QBW fails to account fully for the quantization (or, more pointedly, <span data-wiki="digital">digitization</span>) of space/time<sup>3</sup>, the lack of a <span data-wiki="error">demiurge</span> in such a generated/constructed system, the meaninglessness of physicality in a bit space (i.e., the <span data-wiki="error">holographic principal</span>), and the apparent similarities between the human experience of reality and our standard computational interfaces4.

    <sup>3</sup>Speaking to an artificial or generated source.<br />
    <sup>4</sup>Some rogue simulation theorists have approached this issue in retrograde: perhaps humans are reflecting back core reality in our construction of advanced technology, perhaps "life" is an endless stream of digital reality constructions, a Russian doll of nested yet artificial (aka generated) realities, absent of any real intentionality, linearity5, or deeper purpose.<br />
    <sup>5</sup>In the sense that time, as we commonly experience,  is simply a construct or limiting device<sup>6</sup> specific to this simulation. A parameter, if you will.<br/>
    <sup>6</sup>Reality is a wild math animal, an almost infinitely complex algorithm generated by something like an endless field of neural networks set loose by a set of basic and clearly arbitrary constants (i.e., the speed of light). How could it not be constructed? Maybe this is what it means to be organic. Nature:  an illusion. Physical reality: illusion. Somewhere (in the sense that we experience space), long ago (in the sense that we experience time) a being, a metaphorical or literal teenager, at whatever constitutes a computing terminal, sliding dials, seeding our world of cereal, love, and twilights.
