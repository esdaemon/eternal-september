  <strong>Quantum Loop Gravity AKA GLP [related: Planck Length]</strong> 
  <br />
  Most successful extant theoretical attempt at incorporating both <span data-wiki="quantum">quantum theory</span> and general relativity into a new standard model. Central to Quantum Loop Gravity (QLP) is the hypothesis that spacetime itself (not just energy) is quantized.  In QLP, space/time is essentially pixelated, with each pixel being a binary bit, similar to the use of liquid crystal displays used in commercial televisions starting in the mid-1980's<sup>1</sup>. The equivalent "pixel" in space/time, according to QLP, is the Planck length, a measure of squared space roughly equal to 10<sup>-35</sup> meters. Mathematically speaking, the Planck length represents a <span data-wiki="error">singularity</span> - the dimension at which classical physics goes berserk, yielding nonsensical answers riddled with infinite results<sup>3</sup>. Despite its mathematical origins, QLG paints a startling picture of reality - a two-dimensional, observer-dependent bit space exhibiting aspects of both <span data-wiki="error">simulation theory</span> and the <span data-wiki="error">holographic principle</span>.

    <sup>1</sup>The 8-bit graphic technology used by <span data-wiki="nes">Nintendo</span>, <span data-wiki="atari">Atari</span>, <span data-wiki="sega">Sega</span>, and other early gaming platforms also featured pixelization. <br />

      <li style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><p>Classical physics calculates the empty vacuum of space to be a bastion of electromagnetic energy infinite in scale and force.  </p></li>
      <li style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><p>The density of any <span data-wiki="event-horizon">black hole</span> centerpoint AKA singularity is similarly portrayed as infinite, despite the fact that its spatial dimension is zero. </p></li>
