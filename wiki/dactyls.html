  <strong>Dactyls</strong>
  <br />
  Race of ancient male Greeks associated with the Goddess of Motherhood (The
  Great Mother). The Dactyls originated in Psychro Cave on Cretan Mount Ida and
  were known to be the first humans to use fire as a way of manipulating metal
  (in part due to the discovery of mine-able lead on Crete). The Rhodian
  Dactyls, a sub-group of the race, were a group of chthonic<sup>1</sup>
  men widely feared for their ability to imbue their metal smithing with dark
  magick<sup>2</sup>.
