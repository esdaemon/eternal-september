  <strong><em>Dillinger is Dead </em>[related: Papeete, John Herbert Dillinger]</strong>
  <br />
  A 1969 film by Marco Ferreri starring Michel Piccoli, Anita Pallenberg, and
  Annie Girardot remarkable for its juxtaposition of domestic banality and ultra
  violence. Here "Dillinger" refers not to the film's protagonist but to the Great Depression-era John
  Herbert Dillinger, infamous for his gangster bravado and flamboyant
  personality. The federal government used the pursuit of Dillinger to
  rationalize the development of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (

  and subsequently increasingly sophisticated (and invasive) techniques of
  interrogation and <span data-wiki="error">surveillance</span> (the legality of
  which were subsequently questioned in court by actor/historian

  central character inexplicably uxoricide by shooting his wife in the head and boarding a
  boat to Papeete, Tahiti, a locale associated largely with artist Paul
  Gauguin's depiction of prepubescent nascent sexual deviance - the black sand
  of its beaches later becoming slang (see: Urban Dictionary) for various

  "downtown brown".
