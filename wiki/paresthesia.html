  <strong>Paresthesia</strong> <br />
  Strange skin sensations marked by a lack of perceived central locus point in the mind of the afflicted. Oft compared
  to "eye floaters", the only known paresthesian antidote is to become "one" with the sensation - attempts "collapse"
  the sensation via itching reportedly only intensify the sensation. Extreme paresthesia has led select patients to
  remove up to 70% of their epidermis via scratching.
