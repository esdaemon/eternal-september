  <strong><em>Ringu</em></strong>
  <br />
  Japanese horror film directed by Hideo Nakata released worldwide in 1998. The
  film centers on a psionically created video cassette that murders those who
  view it. The success of the film and its subsequent American remake led to the
  prevalence of "possessed object" horror in the early 20th century, a trend
  often linked to the public's growing apprehension surrounding advances in the
  development of
  <span data-wiki="ai">artificial intelligence</span> (A.I.). The film was a
  stated influence for the late stages of
  <em><span data-wiki="solomons-key">Solomon's Key</span></em>, an <span data-wiki="nes">NES</span> title of byzantine
  difficulty.
