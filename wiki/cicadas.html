  </strong>
  <br />
  A superfamily of insects characterized by its deafening mating call and
  periodic appearance. In full broods, the cicada's lure has been shown to cause
  permanent hearing damage in humans. Studies show the insect's hollow abdomen
  functions as a resonant chamber. However, this de facto biological
  prioritization of sound amplification over proper internal organ development
  serves to dramatically shorten the cicada's lifespan. Remarkably, however,
  cicadas have what amounts to "closable" ears, thus protecting them from
  self-inflicted auditory distress<sup>1</sup>. Most cicadas appear in either 13
  or 17 year increments - emerging almost instantaneously as colossal swarms
  from eight feet below<sup>2</sup> the earth as <em><span data-wiki="imago">imago</span></em>, frantically seeking copulation before death. Super Broods ADD NOTE
  ABOUT
  NASHVILLE 1998 first superbrood since 1777 (the coordination of 13 and 17 year
  broods) occur every 221 years<sup>3</sup> and are characterized by mass ecological
  destruction and documented widespread psychological distress in affected human
  populations<sup>4</sup> - phenomena commonly associated with omens of
  pervasive and sweeping change in both Judeo-Christian mythology and traditional
  occultism.

    <sup>1</sup>Cicadas are also credited with constructing the world's first
    confirmed biomaterial capable of killing bacteria - a system of
    nano-technological wing spikes that functions to rupture bacterial membranes
    upon contact.

    <sup>2</sup>The biological timing mechanism for the emergence of periodic
    cicadas remains a great mystery to the scientific community. However,
    biblical scholars have related the 13 year cycle to Judas Iscariot - the
    betrayer of Jesus and last (13th) to sit at the Great Supper. Further, the
    <em>Book of Daniel </em>portrays the devil as having seven heads and 10
    horns in its portrayal of the apocalypse, signifying 17 as an omen of
    destruction.

    <sup>4</sup>In part due to instances of panicked cicadas mistaking human
    limbs for saplings, attempting in vain to devour said appendages by
    literally suctioning the epidermis.
