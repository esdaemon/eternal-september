  <strong>Imago [related: American Imago, Sigmund Freud]</strong> <br />
  Final stage of insect metamorphosis. Also called the imaginal stage. Imago is characterized by the emergence of
  functional wings<sup>1</sup>, often at the expense of great pain and suffering to the pupa. Starting in the early
  20<sup>th</sup>-century
  the term <em>imago</em> appeared often in the related fields of psychoanalysis and psychology. In 1912, Sigmund Freud
  and his
  disciple Otto Rank established a periodical under the <em>Imago</em> moniker (later renamed <em>American Imago</em> in
  1939) - using the
  term to refer to an entangled mosaic of archetypes and idealized images entrenched in the psyche<em>3</em>. The
  journal came to
  include contributions from a number of notable thinkers including <span data-wiki="immanuel-velikovsky">Immanuel
    Velikovsky</span>, and was often used as a
  platform for Freud's advocation of <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span>, particularly <span
    data-wiki="narcotics">cocaine</span>, as a veritable cure for both physical and mental
  disorders<sup>4</sup>. The term has since found occasional use in popular culture, including a giant mutant fly-like
  boss with
  only partially functional wings in the Metroid series of games by the <span data-wiki="nes">Nintendo Entertainment
    System</span>.

  <p><sup>3</sup>To extend the concept, metamorphosis is then presented as healthy periodic disregarding of outdated
    imago - neurotic is a term used to refer to individuals who lack the creativity and elasticity to shed these
    "shells".</p>
  <p><sup>4</sup>A stance that was undermined by the infamous "Cocaine Episode" in which Freud's friend and patient
    Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow developed acute "cocaine psychosis" while self-medicating for an infection earlier
    acquired during a botched autopsy. Strangely, Freud saw cocaine as a cure for the (at the time much more common)
    addiction to <span data-wiki="narcotics">morphine</span>, reportedly contributing to cocaine's errant classification
    as
    a Schedule II <span data-wiki="narcotics">Narcotic</span> by the
    United States Government in 1922. </p>
