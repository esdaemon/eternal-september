  <strong>Jon & Kate + 8</strong> <br />
  A once frantically popular reality television series<sup>1</sup> that aired on both Discovery Health and The Learning
  Channel.
  JK8, as it is commonly known, gave birth to a tidal wave of lightly scripted, mundane reality content intended to
  function as three dimensional wallpaper. The show's premise centered on "oops sextuplets" born to parents of painfully
  dull twins. The parents Kate and Jon Gosselin filed for divorce midway through the fifth season, resulting in an ugly
  and aggressively litigious custody battle. Having fallen out of syndication following the embarrassing drunken public
  frolicks of Jon, the show's lasting legacy remains the brutalist haircut popularized by Kate beginning in season three
  of the series.
