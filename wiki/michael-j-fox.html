  <strong>Michael J Fox [June 9, 1961-]</strong>
  <br />
  Beloved actor best known for his roles as Jamie in the Canadian Broadcasting
  Network sitcom <em>Leo and Me</em> and Marty McFly in the
  <em>Back to the Future</em> film series. Standing at 5'2", Fox was known for
  his hyper and quirky comedic persona, mullet-styled hair, and "charmingly
  conservative" political stance. At the age of 29, he was diagnosed with
  Parkinson's disease, a condition exacerbated by years of heavy drinking and
  <span data-wiki="narcotics">cocaine</span> use. A federal investigation into the
  production of <em>Leo and Me</em> was launched in 1998 after four additional
  cast and crew members were found to have developed Parkinson's disease,
  including the show's director.
