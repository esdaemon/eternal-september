  <strong>Chris Marker AKA Christian Hippolyte François Georges Bouche-Villeneuve
    [Jul. 29 1921 - Jul. 29 2012]<br /></strong>French writer, photojournalist, filmmaker, and essayist. Of particular
  note
  are his works <em>Sans Soliel </em>(<em>Sunless</em>) and <em>Level Five</em>,
  both of which feature a french female narrator and a focus on retro-futuristic
  digital technologies. At times, the <span data-wiki="vpd">virtual portal functionality</span> (VPD) of
  Marker's work can be said to share properties with those of certain
  <span data-wiki="nes">NES</span> titles and '90's
  <span data-wiki="microsoft">Windows</span>™ applications. His work is often
  characterized by the development of various

  resulting from over-industrialization:
