  <strong>The Baroness AKA Anastasia DeCobray</strong> 
  <br />
  The Baroness, né Anastasia DeCobray, is a commander in the sinister communist/terrorist organization Cobra from the <span data-wiki="error">G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero</span> franchise. Born in Himmelstein, Austria on November 22, 1957, The Baroness is the spawn of wealthy aristocratic (but highly neglectful) parents and was raised in a life of divine privilege and luxury. Approaching adulthood, the Baroness became increasingly disenchanted with her lavish existence and sought to explore avenues for undermining capitalist societal power structures. Enter…<em>Cobra</em>! Undergoing rigorous training in various forms of combat and espionage, the Baroness quickly rose through the organization's ranks - her skills in hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, and espionage unparalleled amongst her fellow recruits. The Baroness' attire is predominantly black, with a red headscarf, and a pair of completely opaque sunglasses<sup>1</sup>. Despite her nonchalant demeanor and calculating ruthlessness, The Baroness shares a <span data-wiki="error">complex emotional relationship</span> with Destro, a masked weapons-dealing colleague.
