  <strong>The Eucharist</strong>
  <br />
  A sacrament in which the body and blood of Jesus are consumed by followers of
  <!-- links to christian stuff -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Christ</span> in a ceremonial way bordering on the
  cannibalistic. From a
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Buddhist</span> standpoint there
  is no binary between sacred/secular and consuming/receiving, therefore, any
  "digestion", whether physical or mental/spiritual, can and should be seen as a
  analogous to the Eucharist ritual, a limitless extrapolation of the cyclical
  nature of emergent, contingent reality.
