  <strong>Atari Corporation</strong>
  <br />
  Japanese technology company founded in 1971 with the mandate of creating an arcade version of the MagnaVox Odyssey
  <em>Tennis Game</em><sup>1</sup>. Atari reached maximum market share with its 1980 release of the Atari Home Video
  Computing System<sup>2</sup>, a console featuring 8KB game cartridges. Faced with extreme computer processing
  restraints, Atari's game designers leaned heavily on abstract and expressionistic gameplay and design, culminating in
  the almost impenetrable <em><span data-wiki="et">E.T.</span></em> Atari rapidly lost market share after the launch of
  the <span data-wiki="nes">Nintendo Entertainment System</span> in 1984 - a downward trend compounded by the release of
  a 1984 report stating that upwards of 90% of Atari 2600's had seriously malfunctioned or ceased operating within 26
  months of purchase. After briefly declaring bankruptcy, Atari was purchased by REDACTED and discontinued production of
  gaming consoles, instead focusing on income generation via the litigation of other gaming manufacturers including
  Nintendo and <span data-wiki="sega">Sega</span> while simultaneously releasing a series of poorly received off-console
  games<sup>4</sup>. After an additional brush with bankruptcy, Atari was bought out in the late 1990's by REDACTED and
  shifted focus to Arcade-themed Hotels, online gambling, <span data-wiki="bitcoin">digital currency development</span>,
  and an aggressive courtship of the LGBT community.
