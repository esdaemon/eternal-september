  <strong>Tower of Babel [related: Tower Myth, Etemenanki]</strong>
  <br />
  Refers both to the Judeo-Christian origin myth involving the dissociation of
  ancient languages and to the physical structure central to the myth's
  narrative. According to scripture, the
  <span data-wiki="enochian">antediluvian</span> world was of one language until
  the building of the Etemenanki<sup>1</sup>, a great Babylonian
  <span data-wiki="ziggurat">ziggurat</span> dedicated to the God
  <span data-wiki="marduk">Marduk</span>. The building was said to "reach unto
  Heaven", in effort to directly access God's omnipotence. Upon observing
  humanity's stunning ability to coordinate and innovate when bonded by a common
  goal, God became frightened and engineered the discrete division of man's
  common language into countless dialects, thus thwarting the completion of the
  structure. According to famed metaphysicist
  <span data-wiki="bicameralism">Julian Jaynes</span>, the Tower of Babel is not
  allegorical but factual and marks the "tipping point" from bi-cameral to
  uni-cameral thinking in the Babylonian people. Here, the "loss of common
  language" is best understood as the loss of the internal "God voice"
  commanding action internally, leading to widespread confusion and panic.
  Instances of parallel etiological Tower Myths (under the larger <span data-wiki="error">Great Catastrophe</span>
  rubric) are startlingly commonplace,
  perhaps marking widespread onset of global uni-camerality. Both Sumerian and
  Assyrian mythology include almost identical lore, and variants occur in the
  mythology of the Toltecs of Mesoamerica<sup>2</sup>, the Tharu of Nepal, the
  Tohono O'odham of Arizona, and various indigenous tribes of Central African
  and Southeast Asia.

  Traditional <span data-wiki="error">Buddhist</span> and biblical scholars view
  the Tower Myth as centering around mankind's virus-like efficiency when
  laboring under the delusion of a collective "hardened mind" (as opposed to an
  Awakened Mind). From this angle, the multiplicity of concurrent Tower Myths
  throughout recorded history point to a periodic actualization of
  <span data-wiki="error">cybernetic loop feedback</span> "crisis points" -
  moments in which misguided techno-reliance (i.e. the artificial digitization
  of Reality) results in the fracturing of collective semanical systems. In such
  cases, core destructive spectral forces appear to emerge from within the
  "<span data-wiki="error">Black Box</span>" but are better understood to be a
  natural consequence of erroneous and harmful beliefs. Additional "crisis
  points" include but are not limited to:
  <span data-wiki="error">The Fall of Man</span>, The Great Flood, the dropping
  of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States at the
  conclusion of the Second World War,

  <span data-wiki="error">Reaganomics</span>, the Great Climate Crisis of the
  21st Century<sup>4</sup>, and, finally, the development of self-replicating
  nanotechnology, autonomous surveillance systems, and sentient forms of
  <span data-wiki="ai">AI</span> resulting in the purported eradication
  mankind from earth, beginning with the destruction of the greater
  <span data-wiki="los-angeles">Los Angeles</span> area in the year 2091, as
  foretold by the "Book of Revelations".

    <sup>3</sup>Initial destruction of the Etemenanki occurred by order of
    Alexander the Great in 300 BCE, concomitant with the commissioning of the
    <span data-wiki="septuagint">Septuagint</span>. Final ruinition took place
    on the orders of Antiochus I, a Seleucidian King originally intent on fully
    restoring the structure. While on a site visit, the King tripped and fell in
    the rubble, suffering great embarrassment, and subsequently ordered the
    Etemenanki's extant components trampled by a fleet of elephants.
