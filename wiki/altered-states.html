  <strong><em>Altered States</em></strong> <br />
  Experimental 1980 body horror film starring William Hurt as Edward Jessup, a psychopathologist studying <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span> and its relationship to subsumed states of consciousness AKA  "<span data-wiki="alters">alters</span>" or "<span data-wiki="alters">alts</span>".  Over the course of the film, Jessup becomes convinced that through sensory deprivation and the use of ceremonial <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span> and <span data-wiki="error">psychedelics</span> he can bring such suppressed alters to the surface and integrate them into a healthy, holistic system of being. Lacking proper human test subjects, Jessup submits himself to a series of increasingly disorienting experiments.  Recklessly pushing further into the void, Jessup eventually experiences biological devolution and emerges from his makeshift sensory deprivation tank as a feral light-skinned troglodyte<sup>1</sup>. The film culminates with Jessup's regression into a maelstrom of primordial ooze that subsequently dissolves into non-physical proto-consciousness. Only a kiss from his estranged wife can save him<sup>2</sup>.

  <p><sup>2</sup>The <em>him</em> most associated with Jessup's primary "public" alter. A fringe but sensical counter-interpretation of the film's ending posits its supposed resolution instead as tragic cliffhanger - Jessup's transcendence into a state of permanent Nirvana thwarted by a misguided and simple-minded shrew.</p>
