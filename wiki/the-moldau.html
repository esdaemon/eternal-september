  <strong><em>The Moldau</em> [related: Bedřich Smetana]</strong> 
  <br />
  Placid and listlessly mellifluous symphonic tone poem by the 18th-century Czech composer Bedřich Smetana. Smetana composed <em>The Moldau</em> in complete silence during an extended period of debilitating misophonia<sup>1</sup> that led eventually to full deafness in both ears (and, subsequently, a state of violent mania for which the composer was later forcibly institutionalized until his death).
