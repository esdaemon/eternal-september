  <strong><em>Stalker</em> (Russian: Сталкер) [related: The Zone]</strong>
  <br />
  Seminal 1979 film by
  <span data-wiki="andrei-tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</span> loosely
  based on the 1972 novel <em>Roadside Picnic</em> by Boris and Arkady
  Strugatsky. The film outlines a journey in and out of
  <span data-wiki="stalker">The Zone</span><sup>1</sup>, an alien-generated<sup>2</sup>
  alternate reality physicalized as having color beyond the sepia lense used in
  the remainder of the film. <em>Stalker</em> centers largely on the almost
  immutable nature of core subconscious desire and the role of radioactive and
  chemical waste as conduits for the supernatural [see: Spiderman]. Due to various environmental
  and interpersonal conflicts, <em>Stalker</em> was shot three separate
  times<sup>3</sup> in areas rife with toxic pollution, consuming over 16,000 feet of film. In the years following
  the release of the film, Tarkovsky and a number of other members of the crew
  died of cancer of the right bronchial tube, including Larisa Tarkovskaya, the
  filmmaker's wife. Despite persistent rumors to the contrary,
  <em>Stalker</em> was <em>not</em> shot in the
  <span data-wiki="error">Chernobyl Zone of Alienation</span><sup>4</sup>—the 1986 nuclear disaster took
  place seven years after the film's release. Remarkably, however, the film alludes repeatedly to the [quote] "breakdown
  of the fourth bunker" and features numerous shots of distant power plants, adding credence to claims that Tarkovsky
  himself was <span data-wiki="error">clairvoyant</span><sup>5</sup>.

    <sup>2</sup>The origin of the Zone is never clearly delineated in the film - "alien" here refers to something of strange or unknown origin.

    <sup>3</sup>Crew from the film claim the second and third shootings are almost identical, with the only difference being the removal of Georgy Rerberg, the film's original cinematographer, from all crediting materials.

    <sup>4</sup><em>Stalker</em> was shot on the Jägara River in Tallinn, Estonia.

    <sup>5</sup>A claim supported by Tarkovsky's fascination with and subsequent tutelage under famed psychic <span data-wiki="ninel-kulagina">Ninel Kulagina</span> whose extensively documented telekinetic abilities directly influenced the closing sequence of the film.
