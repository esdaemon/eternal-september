  <strong>Copiale Cipher [related: Oculists]</strong> <br />
  An extensive ciphertext dating from around 1776 whose origin was unknown for
  over 260 years. The Copiale Cipher consists of almost 100,000 individual
  characters in a 100 page handwritten volume. Finally decoded by computer in
  the 1990s, the text outlines various rites of initiation knowledge transference
  within the Oculists, a group of German
  <span data-wiki="error">freemasons</span>. The Oculists positioned light at
  the center of existence and equated its presence with direct knowledge.
  <span data-wiki="luciferin">Lucifer</span>, in his role as "light bringer", is
  central to the Oculist practice, leading to claims by Pope Clement XII of
  Satanism, thus forcing the group to meet in secret and code its various
  materials.
