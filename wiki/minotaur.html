  <strong>Minotaur [related: Daedalus]</strong>
  <br />
  Mythological resident of the sub-Cretan <span data-wiki="error">labyrinthian</span> world of Daedalus<sup>1</sup>
  (father of Icarus and Iapyx) oft referred to as Guardian of the Portal. In
  modern times the Minotaur has come to represent the concept of "false
  adversaries" (mass delusions resulting from the human aversion to
  complex distress as represented by The Maze - see below).
</p>
<p>
  The Maze AKA The Labyrinth consists of a closed
  <!-- links to cybernetics -->
  <span data-wiki="error">black box cybernetic loop</span>:
</p>
<p>Birth→Life→Death→Birth→ etc.,</p>
<p>
  Vanquishing at the hands of "false adversary" leads automatically to return of
  birth state - a situation with stark parallels in
  <em><span data-wiki="metroid">Metroid</span></em>, <em><span data-wiki="zelda">The Legend of Zelda</span></em>, and
  other

  <span data-wiki="error">infinite loop</span>-featuring
  <span data-wiki="vpd">VPD</span>s. Only with full realization that the maze is in
  fact a mental construct based on false assumptions about the nature of reality
  can one in fact become free of the maze. The suggested method for actualizing
  this realization has its basis in pacifism and mindfulness: accurately view
  the source issue and reduce its complexity via direct experience and deep
  contemplation AKA

    <sup>1</sup>Daedalus was set to have possessed such sharp sculpting skills
    that his carvings often came to possess self-motion, needing to be chained
    to the wall. Though the finest in the land, his sculptures often remain
    unsold, possibly due to a pre-<span data-wiki="a-i">A.I.</span> "<span data-wiki="error">uncanny valley</span>" effect.
