  parallels the transition of Babylon from a peripheral Mesopotamian city-state
  to the center of an expansive and sophisticated empire. The Babylonian's
  reverence of Marduk bordered on the maniacal and developed into the first
  documented system of monotheism in the ancient world, a process inextricably
  linked to the evolution of

  dating from around 700BC, outlines Babylon's brutal fall<sup>2</sup> to the
  Elamites and its subsequent emancipation under the leadership of a Great King

    <sup>3</sup>Throughout the centuries, scholars have questioned the validity
    of the Murduk Prophecy, with many assigning authorship to Nebuchadnezzar
    himself. However, Cambridge University's D.J. Wiseman claimed in 1975 that
    the Prophecy was valid and essentially self-actualizing and that it was
    composed by <span data-wiki="bicameralism">bi-cameral</span> priests in the
    House of The Exorcist channeling the voice of God prior to 1100 BCE.
