  Experimental No Wave New York City-based music ensemble active in the early/mid 1980's. The group's work was marked by the intersection of jazz fusion, synth pop, and carnatic music. Beyond its musical style, little about the group is known - a cover-less three song demo EP stands as the group's only official documentation. A smattering of video material was, at some point, posted on <span data-wiki="phantom-archives">Phantom Archives</span> using ripped footage from various cartoons, television shows, and journalistic interviews. It remains unclear if those materials were generated by the digital archivist or the group itself. The group's archivist claimed that members of the group went on to help form other prominent groups of the No Wave movement, including <span data-wiki="digital-riptide">Digital Riptide</span> and the <span data-wiki="error">Spaceships of Ezekiel</span>.
