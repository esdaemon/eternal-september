  <strong>Skinemax [related: Cinemax]</strong> <br />
  Debuting in 1980 as a 24-hr movie channel focusing on films of the '50's and
  '70's, Cinemax became colloquially known as Skinemax following the
  controversial launch of its <em>Friday After Dark</em> series - the first
  basic cable programming block to explicitly depict sexual intercourse. The
  success of the series led Cinemax to extend adult programming to each night of
  the week, and to become the first movie channel to actively program R-rated
  movies during daytime hours. The late 1980's saw Cinemax expand its offerings
  into original programming and music-oriented content including the A.I.-based
  absurdist comedy series
  <em><span data-wiki="max-headroom">Max Headroom</span>.</em> Despite the widespread
  brand recognition and popularity of its Skinemax moniker, Cinemax unilaterally
  halted all adult programming following the acquisition of its parent company
  TimeWarner by <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span> in 2017.
