  <strong>EternalBlue</strong> 
  <br />
  In the spring of 2019, Baltimore, Maryland was the victim of the largest ransomware attack in US history. The attack, still of unknown origin, used a government-developed <span data-wiki="microsoft">Windows</span>™ exploit called <span data-wiki="error">EternalBlue</span> to disable all government servers. The hackers demanded 13 <span data-wiki="bitcoin">Bitcoin</span> in exchange for restitution of server functionality. Following the incident, the municipality blamed the US government for having developed the exploit, while the US government accused Baltimore of not having updated its computer systems in over five years and running what it claimed was a "veritable colander of a security system". It is currently estimated that around 80% of Windows™ operating systems remain vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit.
