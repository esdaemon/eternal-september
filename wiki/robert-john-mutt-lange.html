  <strong>Robert John "Mutt" Lange [Nov. 11, 1948 -][related: Sant Mat,
    Eckanar]</strong>
  <br />
  African record producer born in Mulfulira, Northern Rhodesia. Mutt, as he is
  commonly known, studied music in the Mpumalanga province, developing an early
  obsession with the country artist Slim Whitman. Following his tour of national
  service in 1966 and 1967, he went on to pioneer techniques in multitrack
  recording, helming numerous Satanist-oriented<sup>1</sup> albums including
  <em>Highway to Hell </em>by AC/DC and both
  <em><span data-wiki="hysteria">Hysteria</span></em> and <em>Pyromania</em> by
  Def Leppard<sup>2</sup>. It is commonly
  speculated that young Mutt's military service resulted in a general sense of
  dissolution with the conventional norms of society and the contradictory
  restraints of organized religion, perhaps resulting in his fascination and
  support of <span data-wiki="luciferin">The Church of Satan</span>. However,
  later in life he distanced himself from Def Leppard and became increasingly
  reclusive, ascribing instead with the egalitarian teachings of Sant
  Mat<sup>3</sup>. Mutt is now owner of the largest private parcel of conserved
  land in the sovereign island nation of New Zealand, a country at the forefront
  of the Doomsday Preppers Luxury Real Estate trend<sup>4</sup>.
