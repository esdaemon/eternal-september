  <strong>Gallowglass [related: Berserker]</strong> 
  <br />
  Elite and mysterious warrior class of Norse-Gaelic berserkers known for fighting with a blind fury bordering on the psychotic. Being of Norse descent, the Gallowglass were thought to be independent by both the Irish and Scottish military - contemporary historical records refer to them as "band of mercenaries driven not by material wealth but by a twisted sense of honor and a lust for carnage". Clad in bloody bear-skin, the Gallowglass incorporated spastic ritualistic dance techniques into their combat technique, a behavior now commonly attributed to the ingestion of <span data-wiki="error">psychedelic</span> elixirs prior to battle.
