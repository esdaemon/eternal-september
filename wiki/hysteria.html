  <strong><em>Hysteria</em> [Aug. 3rd, 1987][related: Def Leppard]</strong>
  <br />
  Concept album produced by
  <span data-wiki="robert-john-mutt-lange">Robert John "Mutt" Lange</span> and
  conceived by drummer Rick Allen following the severing of his right arm in an
  auto accident in Sheffield, England on Dec. 31, 1984. The album traces the
  origin and effect of the female species through the lense of extended
  <!-- links to self -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Christian Theology</span> [see diagram below]. The
  album is seen by many as a precursor to early 90's hip-hop due to the absence
  of crash cymbals or other percussive accoutrement resulting from Allen's
  injuries (an accident numerous leaders of the Christian community have since
  attributed to divine retribution against the band for its portrayal of God as
  vengeful/lustful throughout the album, which was in production at the time of
  the accident.)

  <em>Women</em>
  <br />
  Outlines God's malicious creation of Female as resulting from his being "born
  with a passion, love and hate" and lays clear blame on the Siren-esque appeal
  of feminine energy as the primary destructive force of humanity.

  <em>Animal</em>
  <br />
  Further establishes the feminine's ability to render Man helpless. "All I
  want, all I need, and I lust", "make me your animal".

  <em>Love Bites</em>
  <br />
  Depiction of helpless involvement in lustful, perverse relationship ending
  with the subliminal whisper <span data-wiki="error">"Jesus of Nazareth, go to Hell"</span>.

  <em>Don't Shoot Shotgun</em>
  <br />
  Focuses on the turncoat nature of femininity as both an energizing and
  destructive force, appearing at first gentle and then vicious, a "dove turned
  destroyer".

  <em>Hysteria</em>
  <br />
  Culminates in the masculine's eventual complete emotional and physical
  paralysis at the hands of the femine, with the feminine subsequently taking on
  the function as Godhead: "hypnotized, I'm shaking to my knees".
