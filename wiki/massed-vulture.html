  <strong>Massed Vulture Mountain</strong> 
  <br />
  Sixteen years following his enlightenment, Gautama Buddha shared his core teaching, <em>The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom</em>, to over 5,000 monks, nums, and laity, at Griddhakuta Peak (AKA Vulture Peak). While speaking, Gautama was circled by countless enlightened bodhisattvas appearing corporeally as vultures.
