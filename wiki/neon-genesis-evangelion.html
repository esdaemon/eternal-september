  <strong><em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> [related: Hideaki Anno, <em>End of Evangelion</em>, Fan Servicing]</strong> 
  <br />
  A highly lauded and widely controversial <span data-wiki="mech">mecha</span> anime television series created and directed by the brilliant and emotionally tortured Hideaki Anno. Over the course of its 26 initial episodes, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE)</em> recounts a Russian-doll system of existential battles against the "Angels", a series of mysterious seemingly extraterrestrial beings terrorizing "Toyko-3". The series featured a dizzying symbological swirl of almost byzantine complexity including numerous references to Judeo and <span data-wiki="error">Christian mythology</span>. <em>NGE</em> includes numerous allusions to Midrash stories, Zohar imagery and other Kabbalah-derived materials originally stemming from the Book of Genesis. Anno often pointed to Schopenhauer and <span data-wiki="imago">Freud</span> as core influences - oedipal undertones abound throughout the series. The Freudian concept of "death drive" is overtly woven into various character arcs. Anno's refusal to identify a full origin story for the existence of the Angels and employment of occasional magical realism was seen by some critics as <span data-wiki="andrei-tarkovsky">Tarkovskian</span> in nature, an attribution Anno acknowledged and embraced.

  The reception for <em>NGE</em> was lukewarm upon its release, but public support for the series built to a fervor over the course of its run<sup>1</sup>. However, the final two episodes of the series proved to be extremely divisive. Taking place entirely in the mind of the pubescent main character, episodes 25-26 paralleled Anno's own mental and emotional breakdown. The material was at times completely abstract,  consisting of Kandinsky-esque shapes and muffled sounds, crayon drawings, and long dreamlike montages featuring almost indecipherable soliloquies. <em>End of Evangelion</em>, created following an extended period of mental health treatment, served as Anno's re-attempt at concluding <em>NGE</em> is a more coherent and compelling manner<sup>2</sup>. Anno later abandoned all further forays into animation in protest of stringent government content restrictions resulting from the <span data-wiki="error">Pok√©mon Shock Incident</span>.

  Throughout <em>NGE</em>, music played a pivotal roll. Anno, himself an amateur musician, insisted on a brutally economical approach to scoring, using essentially four alternating themes throughout the entire series to help demarcate specific sections of content<sup>3</sup>. <em>NGE</em>'s opening and closing credit sequences became the subject of fan obsession. Due to cost cutting measures, the original credit music, including the legendarily strange <!--link to htc content-->"<span data-wiki="error">Fly Me to the Moon</span>" closing sequence, was not licensed for the ill-fated American reboot of <em>NGE</em>. Poorly executed credit rescorings by the progressive rock group <span data-wiki="octagon-of-dex">Octagon of Dex</span> only fanned the flames of public discontent, contributing both to the cancellation of the reboot and the dissolution of the band.
