  <strong>Chemtrails</strong> <br />
  Portmanteau of "chemical" and "trail", chemtrails are chemically altered
  "contrails" (the condensation trails tracing the sky in the wake of
  high-flying aircraft) marked by lack of timely dissipation<sup>1</sup>.
  Although the nature and purpose of the alteration is unknown, the intent is
  considered by many to be nefarious. Speculations include covert government-led
  human population control, weather manipulation (i.e. cloud seeding), and solar
  radiation management. The concept of chemtrails followed logically from a
  leaked United States Air Force (USAF) document outlining approaches to weather
  modification, and intensified in 2013 when it was revealed that significant
  funding was granted by the

  of Sciences for geoengineering initiatives. The presence of frequent
  chemtrails over California's imperial valley from 2011-2017 has been used to
  support the California Drought Manipulation Theory. In 2014 a class action
  suit was launched by the Shasta County Board of Supervisors demanding federal
  investigation into the origin and effect of chemtrails.

    <sup>1</sup>Chemtrails lasting in excess of 7 hours (approximately 6 hours
    and 54 minutes longer than standard vapour trails need to completely
    dissipate) have been documented on numerous occasions, most notably
    throughout Southeastern California over and around the
