  <strong>23 Enigma AKA Principle of 23</strong> 
  <br />
  The belief that the number 23 appears with unusual frequency in relation to events or circumstances of shrouded intent or otherwise particular significance. The 23 enigma is a central tenet of <span data-wiki="error">Discordianism</span>, popularized by <span data-wiki="error">Robert Anton Wilson</span>'s epic <em>Illumantus!</em> Trilogy of books. Wilson claimed the number 23 to be of great importance to the Illuminati, essentially functioning as a secret code by which they communicate. <em>Principia Discordia</em>, the sacred text of Discordianism, posits 23 as the sacred number of <em>Eris</em>, goddess of discord and chaos. Initially disregarded as mere tomfoolery, the theory received a boon when, on December 22nd, biologists Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan discovered that the human gene contains 23 pairs of chromosomes – not 24 as previously believed.  Taboot, in 1962, it was discovered that the average human physical biorhythm is 23 days and that the blood circulates the body in its entirety every 23 seconds.

      The Cabalists have long postulated the existence of a missing letter in the Torah - a digit carrying great significance and mystery. Were that letter to be found, the Torah would be based on a series of 23, not 22, letters. The Torah predicts this letter will be revealed to the nation of Judah during the next terrestrial period, approximately 2300 years in the future.

      Composer <span data-wiki="alban-berg">Alban Berg</span> recognized 23's significance, using it to structure several of his most prominent works, including the cryptographical <em><span data-wiki="error">Lyric Suite</span></em>. Various suggestions have been made as to the origins of his interest: perhaps the Biorhythms theory of Wilhelm Fliess, in which a 23-day time cycle is considered significant? Because he suffered an almost fatal asthma attack on 23rd of February?
