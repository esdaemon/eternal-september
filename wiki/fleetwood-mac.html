  <strong>Fleetwood Mac</strong> 
  <br />
  Highly incestuous British-American musical ensemble active throughout the 1970's and 1980's. Fleetwood Mac came into public awareness through the partial scoring of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1973 German television serial <em><span data-wiki="weld-am-draht">Weld am Draht</span></em>. Throughout the 1980's, Fleetwood Mac was plagued by internal romantic promiscuity and rampant <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span> abuse. Prior to the group's eventual disbanding in the late 1990's, eponymous founding member Mick Fleetwood came out in support of conspiracy theorist <span data-wiki="error">David Icke</span> - particularly his theories regarding the <span data-wiki="error">Reptilian Conspiracy Theory</span> and its connection to the <span data-wiki="error">Silurian Hypothesis</span>.
