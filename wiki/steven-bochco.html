  <strong>Steven Bochco [Dec. 16, 1943 - Apr. 1, 2018, BFA Carnegie Mellon
    University, 1966]</strong>
  <br />
  Writer/producer of semi-impermanent and at times abstract sci-fi, legal and
  law enforcement-based television dramas through the 1980's and early 1990's
  including
  <em>Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, NYPD Blue</em>, and the never-aired
  hyper-realistic Hawaiin-based series
  <em><span data-wiki="byrds-of-paradise">Byrds of Paradise</span></em>. Widely credited for the introduction of
  extended story arcs into weekly
  primetime dramas<sup>1</sup>, Bochco is commonly known as the father of
  experimental network television. As a showrunner, Bochco was notorious for
  extremely risky and sometimes ill-advised production choices, resulting in the
  almost immediate cancellation of multiple series: titles including the
  cyberspace-based Neuromancer offshoot

  <span data-wiki="error">SKYNET SYNDROME</span>, and

  <span data-wiki="error">My Nepenthe</span>, a time-travel/cocaine trafficking
  show taking place in both ancient and modern Greece. Born to a concert
  violinist, musical scoring, especially opening credits, were of vital import
  to Bochco<sup>2</sup>. Throughout his oeuvre, music played an outsized role by
  contemporary standards<sup>3</sup> - whether it be the choice to present Cop
  Rock as a musical, or his frequent engagement of the mildly progressive rock
  group
