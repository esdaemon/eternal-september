  <strong>T-1 Carrier AKA T-carrier</strong> <br />
  Technology developed by <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span> at
  <span data-wiki="error">Bell Laboratories</span>, in part to circumvent the
  infiltration into the multi-frequency automation by phone hackers, or
  <span data-wiki="phreaking">phreaks</span>. T-carriers marked the first use of
  <!-- links to digital -->
  <span data-wiki="digital">digitization</span> in commercial communication
  technology and provided exponentially greater speeds of transmission data via
  the translation and reduction (and subsequent reconstitution) of audio signals
  into binary bits via <span data-wiki="codex">codec</span>. T-1 technology
  could not be operated via Plane Old Telephone Service Lines (POTS) and
  required the installation of massive amounts of new hardware. T-1 lines were
  able to transmit data along with audio and quickly became the preferred
  conduit for hi-speed infiltration into corporate and governmental cyberspace
  by the <span data-wiki="error">Legion of Doom</span>,
  <span data-wiki="error">Masters of Deception</span>, and extended
  <span data-wiki="phiber-optik">@Cafe</span> hacking communities.
