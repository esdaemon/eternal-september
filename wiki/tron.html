  <strong><em>Tron</em> [disambiguation:
    <span data-wiki="metatron">Metatron</span>]</strong><br />Speculative fiction film starring Jeff Bridges (Kevin
  Flynn) and
  advised by famed computer scientist/jazz guitarist Alan Kay released in 1982
  to widespread critical apathy. The film centers on the Master Control Program
  (MCP) of the computer conglomerate ENCOM<sup>1</sup> - a cyber-entity found to
  have become sentient by <span data-wiki="dillinger-is-dead">Dillinger</span>,
  the company's senior vice president. Knowing that Dillinger has continually
  plagiarized Flynn's work, the MCP engages in blackmail<sup>2</sup>. While
  attempting to hack the ENCOM system to find evidence of said plagiarism, Flynn
  is digitized by the MCP and downloaded via experimental laser where he finds a
  non-spatial cyber-reality characterized by game systems in which the loser is
  "derezzed". <em>Tron </em>is often cited as the film industry's first attempt
  at representing the digitally infinite<sup>3</sup>, paralleling the development of William
  Tyler Bell's <span data-wiki="error">infinity principle</span>.

    <sup>2</sup>The MCP's motivation for engaging in blackmail is never
    explicitly stated. Speculation has centered on the MCP's frequent and
    anachronistic employment of outdated and seemingly misguided sexual
    innuendo.
