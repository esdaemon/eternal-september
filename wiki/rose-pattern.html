  <strong>Rose Patterns AKA Rose Curves</strong> <br />
<p>A term referring to both floral and mathematical shapes: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: 13px;">
  Let r = sin(nÎ¸) be a rose in the polar coordinate system, where n is a positive integer. The rose has n petals if n is
  odd, and 2n petals if n is even. We then take 361 points on the rose: (sin(nk), k) (k = 0, d, 2d, 3d, ..., 360d),
  where d is a positive integer and the angles are in degrees, not radians.

  The above equations refer
  specifically to the rhodonea curve, a sinusoid plotted in polar
  coordinates. In the case of rose patterns/curves, a sinusoid also functions as
  sound mapping (aka a Sine Wave). Thus "rose patterns" comes to represent both
  the visual and aural phenomena of linear organic networks and systems.
  Philosophically the term commonly refers to the interconnectivity of hard math
  and such organic systems<sup>1</sup> as evidenced by autumn leaf patterns, bird
  formations, honeycombs, snowflakes and other naturally occurring fractals.
