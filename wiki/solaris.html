  <strong><em>Solaris</em> (Russian: Солярис) [related: Panpsychism, DASST]</strong>
  <br />
  Science fiction film by
  <!-- links to self *ready* -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Andrei Tarkovsky</span> released in 1972 dealing
  rooted in panpsychism<sup>1</sup> as evidenced by the eponymous central
  character, <!--links to solaris poem in sp--><span data-wiki="error">a sentient ocean planet</span> capable of rendering the private desires of
  astronauts as material hallucinations via the manipulation of neutrino
  systems. A crew in orbit above the planet is plagued by these spectral visages. The film's central protagonist, a psychologist named Kris Kelvin, is driven mad by the repeated visitations of his ex-lover Hari. Late in the film, the replica drinks liquid oxygen, mirroring Hari's death by suicide ten years preceding - only to be painfully resurrected by the planet, its intentions unknown.

  In metaphysical circles, <em>Solaris</em> is seen to support the Discrete Alien Semanical System Theory (<span data-wiki="solaris">DASST</span>) stating that the
  composition and functionality of any "alien" organism
  would be sufficiently foreign and completely isolated from our own systems of
  interaction. Without any direct particle entanglement or similar perceptual
  system any corresponding semantical systems
  between entities would essentially be invisible and completely inaccessible,
  thus the development of conduits of communication with alternate life forms is
  essentially impossible. The DASST is founded upon the
  <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist</span>/<span data-wiki="error">quantum</span>
  principle of all-pervasiveness of mind (i.e. the mind as the locus point of
  reality), emergent phenomena/causality, and the inherent "emptiness" of all
  things. On this basis, it stands to reason that alien life systems may be
  plentiful (perhaps infinitely plentiful) throughout the universe, even within
  our own solar system, yet completely undetectable because their atomic
  configuration either appears to us random [Newtonian Interpretation] or their
  collective wave function lacks any entanglement with ours [Quantum
  Interpretation]. Furthermore, it could be then extrapolated that "death" is
  simply the transition to another discrete semantical system/wave function via
  the exiting of corporeal form and that sentient human life continues in what
  amounts to be a parallel yet inaccessible universe (heaven/hell).
