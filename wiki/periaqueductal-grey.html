  <strong>Periaqueductal Grey (AKA PAG, Central Grey)</strong> <br />
  A cluster of neurons in the human brain peripheral to the cerebral aqueduct.
  PAG takes the form of gray matter and plays a central function in analgesia
  (pain reduction), abstract mania (see: <span data-wiki="apeirophobia">apeirophobia</span>), and autonomic responses to
  threatening stimuli. The PAG's
  high concentration opioid receptors are activated by many
  <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics</span> including morphine, hydrocodone,
  and oxycodone. Natural PAG opioid stimulants include waves of extreme
  nostalgia, teenage fellatio, and <span data-wiki="dharma">Dharmic</span> transcendence of self. The PAG plays
  a central role in "fight or flight response": extreme and stimulation of the
  area due to real (or imagined) threat can lead to a misleadingly lackadaisical
  posture known as quiescence<sup>1</sup>. Overstimulated PAG can become
  activated pathologically resulting in dysregulation - a state commonly
  associated with the development of various forms of psychosis, most notably
