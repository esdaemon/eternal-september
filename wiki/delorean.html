  <strong>DeLorean [related: <em>Back to the Future</em>]</strong>
  <br />
  The sole automotive product produced by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company
  (DMC). The Delorean was notable for its stainless steel body<sup>1</sup>,
  gullwing doors, and dismal manufacturing and performance. With a tepid top
  speed of 89 mph and horsepower of 130 (roughly the equivalent of a John Deere
  lawn tractor), the DeLorean failed to garner support from the fickle "sports
  car enthusiast" community. The DMC's first production car was completed in
  January 1981, and the company declared bankruptcy in December 1982 while John
  DeLorean was on trial for <span data-wiki="narcotics">cocaine</span> trafficking<sup>2</sup>. Despite its fiscal
  failings, the DeLorean remains a locus point of public
  <span data-wiki="error">technostalgia</span> in large part due to its inclusion in the
  <em>Back to the Future</em> film franchise<sup>3</sup> starring
  <span data-wiki="michael-j-fox">Michael J. Fox</span>. Throughout the film series, a
  DeLorean modified with a plutonium generator<sup>3</sup> breaks the time/space
  continuum by achieving the top speed of 88 miles an hour.

    <sup>1</sup>A notable exception being a series of three gold-plated models
    (out of a planned 100). Of these, two (VIN #4300 and #4301) were purchased
    by wealthy private individuals and the third was given away as part of a Big
    Lots store raffle (VIN #20105).

    <sup>2</sup>John DeLorean was eventually acquitted despite being found in
    possession of over 60 lbs. of cocaine. His lawyers
    successfully argued police entrapment via James Timothy Hoffman, an
    <!-- links to self -->
    <span data-wiki="error">FBI</span>-informant and estranged former neighbor attempting to
    broker a reduced sentence for cocaine trafficking. It was claimed in trial
    that Hoffman approached DeLorean because of his widely publicized financial
    difficulties - in fact DeLorean concluded his own court testimony by
    offering a steep discount on used models of his car to the judge and court
    stenographer.

    <sup>3</sup>As differentiated from the 1990 <span data-wiki="nes">NES</span> game
    <em>Back to the Future Part II & III</em>, a title with notoriously awkward
    gameplay<sup>4</sup> requiring the player to spend upwards of 6 hours hand
    mapping chasms in the spacetime continuum. The game is thought to be
    unintentionally unwinnable - each timeline jump generates a "Marty clone"
    capable of neutralizing the player with the slightest touch. Informal
    calculations from within the gaming community claim that virtually all
    available pixels would be coded as "Marty clone" by game's end, making
    movement essentially impossible.

    <sup>4</sup>A noted outlier being the "acorn effect" â€” a gameplay feature
    involving the planting of acorns in past timelines in order to use fully
    grown trees to access higher spaces (necessary due to the game's lack of a
    jump button).
