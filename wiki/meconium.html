  <strong>Meconium</strong> <br />
  Black tar-like substance that collects inside the fetal intestines while in
  utero. Standard hospital policy dictates that expectant parents are not
  alerted to its presence until the placenta has been successfully delivered.
  Often a pamphlet is given upon discharge entitled "<em>Meconium and Beyond</em
  >" including inflammatory information on
  <span data-wiki="crib-death">Crib Death</span> and directions for freezing and
  post-natal consumption of the placenta by the mother in the form of
  high-protein smoothies.
