  <strong>The Woman in the Dunes AKA 砂の女</strong> 
  <br />
  An existentialist novel by Japanese author Kōbō Abe originally published in 1962. The novel centers on an entomologist trapped with a lonely woman  in a sand pit by a group of villagers. Over time, the novel's protagonist begins to see his imprisonment as freedom, developing deep feelings for the woman and forgoing escape when given the opportunity. <em>The Woman in the Dunes</em> opens with the aphorism: "Without the threat of punishment, there is no joy in the fight". Abe's equating of entrapment and eroticism throughout the novel proved controversial in 1960's  Japan, as was the film's ruthlessly experimental soundtrack<sup>1</sup>.
