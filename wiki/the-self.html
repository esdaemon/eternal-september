  <strong>The Self [disambiguation: self]</strong> <br />
  Quotes presented around "I" are often meant to differentiate the discrete, artificially conceptualized self from the unadulterated form, <em>I</em>. In such cases, the quotes stand in recognition of the integrated duality of self/not self and consciousness's arising within the emergent <span data-wiki="error">Emptiness</span> that comprises the true nature of reality in the <span data-wiki="error">Buddhist/Quantum</span> worldview. In this light, "Self/I" can be said to represent the resolution of various false binaries, functioning instead as a fulcrum point between subjective and objective perspectives.
