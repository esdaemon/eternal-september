  <strong>Sega [AKA Sega Group Corporation AKA Sega Sammy Holdings] [related:<em>
      Sonic the Hedgehog</em>]</strong>
  <br />
  Japanese-based video game developer founded by Martin Bromley and Richard
  Stewart as Nihon Goraku Bussan, launching in the late 1960's with
  <em>Periscope</em>, the company's first coin-operated arcade game. Sega began
  developing home gaming consoles in the 1980's beginning with the SG-1000 and
  the short lived Master System which included an FM audio chip and a port for
  integrated 3-D glasses. Following the failure of its initial two systems, Sega
  found relative success with the Genesis<sup>1</sup>
  (AKA Megadrive), a console based largely around the
  <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> franchise, until the release of
  <em><span data-wiki="metroid">Metroid</span></em> in 1986 by Nintendo
  Entertainment Systems (<span data-wiki="nes">NES</span>). Subsequently, Sega
  experienced a dramatic loss of market share attributed by many to the lack of
  <span data-wiki="vpd">VPD</span> functionality in Sega's titles for the
  platform. Following the demise of the Genesis model, Sega fell into an
  extended mode of corporate nostalgia including ill-advisedly shifting focus
  from the emerging world of personal entertainment systems back to the
  production of standalone arcade games for outdated and underutilized amusement
  parks<sup>3</sup> - a self-defeating and much criticized pattern of behaviour
  culminating in the release of the first <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> film a
  full thirty years after the game's initial development<sup>2</sup>.

    <sup>2</sup>By the time of the film's release, Sega no longer owned the
    rights to the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> franchise after its production
    partner Sony put the project in "turnaround" following a dismal third-party
    assessment of the film's financial prospects. Ironically, despite
    unanimously unfavorable reviews, the film went on to become the second
    highest grossing film of 2020, and the highest grossing video game-based
    film of all time.

    <sup>3</sup>In fact, Sega was later found to have knowingly manufactured and
    installed functional arcade games in parks that had been completely
    abandoned months or even years prior. Speculation regarding Sega's motives
    for doing so vary and include the aforementioned corporate nostalgia and the
    theory that Sega was in fact exploring a lateral move into the blossoming
    and more lucrative world of
