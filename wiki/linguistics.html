  <strong>Linguistics</strong> 
  <br />
  The study of emergent semantical systems between human sub-groups, often seen as arising from a figurative or literal "<span data-wiki="error">fall from grace</span>" or "extradition from paradise" (the sound of <span data-wiki="error">bells</span>). The need for complex, verbalized language can be said to exist in absence of or in compensation for a lost sense of "knowingness" aka direct experiential access to base reality or the <span data-wiki="dharma">Emptiness</span>. Semantical systems are dimensional in that they physically rewire the brain and give rise to different uses of our perceptual system (i.e. the common ability of indigenous un- or recently contacted tribes to visualize their surroundings from above). Thus language is essentially an organizational device for raw, boundlessly free flowing and seamlessly interrelated data, a "reduction and subsequent extrapolation" of essentially meaningless non-physical interactions into a coherent yet artificial system of navigation. In this light, mental delusions (i.e. <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</span>) are rooted not in the physical brain but in malformed semanical circuitry, more specifically the tendency to apply materialistic properties to mental constructs resulting from a highly limited perceptual system - a phenomenon explored at length in the work of <span data-wiki="error">Donald Hoffman</span>. Such circuitry is only developed and made "real" through its <span data-wiki="error">cybernetic</span> interaction with other systems i.e. people, thus commonly diagnosed diseases of delusion can be seen simply as severe divergences from normative and shared language systems and NOT simply as objective mental illness. The core fluidity and flexibility present in the semantical systems of conscious agents is also present in the cybernetic learning systems of digital <span data-wiki="ai">artificial intelligence</span> [see: <span data-wiki="knight-rider">Knight Rider</span>], a commonality often cited by supporters of <span data-wiki="error">simulation theory</span>.
