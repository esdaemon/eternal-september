  <strong><em>Metal Gear Solid</em> [Konami, 1987-][related: The End, Hideo Kijima,
    Psycho Mantis]</strong>
  <br />
  Ongoing series of stealth action video games developed and directed by Hideo
  Kijima centering on the pursuit of Metal Gear, a nuclear-armed bipedal form of
  walking <span data-wiki="ai">A.I.</span> with the capability of destroying
  humanity. The series' protagonist is most often Solid Snake, a special forces
  operative based on <em>Escape from New York</em>'s Snake Plissken (played by
  award-winning actor Kurt Russell). Notable for its exploration of
  philosophical issues, regular breaking of the fourth wall, and the almost
  byzantine complexity of its story lines, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> stands as a
  prime example of <span data-wiki="vpd">VPD</span> functionality. Moments of "palpable poignance" from the
  series are too numerous to catalog and include:
</p>
<ul class="wiki-ul">
  <li>
    Psycho Mantis, a floating man in a gas mask and self-proclaimed
    <!-- links to self -->
    <span data-wiki="error">clairvoyant</span>. Snake's encounter with Psycho
    Mantis begins with the possession and attempted seduction of Meryl, the
    game's female protagonist and culminates with Psycho Mantis taking control
    of the player's controller, causing it to shake vigorously<sup>1</sup>.
    Defeat of Psycho Mantis only occurs upon removal of the game controller from
    port 1 and insertion into port 2, thereby disabling the villain's ability to
    telekinetically control and predict Snake's movements.
  </li>

  <li>
    The End, the parrot-loving centenarian villain of
    <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>. Although The End's skills in stealth,
    marksmanship , and camouflage are unparalleled, he can be defeated via an
    inordinate number of week-long saves<sup>2</sup>, thus causing him to die of
    old age.
  </li>

  <li>
    Numerous instances of defecation and urination factoring into
    <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>'s gameplay, including characters soiling
    themselves out of fear and the "Wolf Box", an elaborate process involving
    wolves urinating on a box in which Snake is concealed, thus rendering him
    safe from wolf attack for the remainder of the game.

</ul>
<p>
  Cyberpunk, as portrayed by <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span> in
  <em>Neuromancer, </em>is a stated influence of Kijima's, as are the works of
  <span data-wiki="gravitys-rainbow">Thomas Pynchon</span>. Games influenced by
  the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series are too numerous to name, though the
  "cornfield" in Second Life is often cited as a notable and direct nod Kijima's
  work.

    <sup>1</sup>Upon release of the game the mechanism used by Psycho Mantis to
    take possession of the port 1 controller was unclear and led to accusations of
    <!-- links to self? -->
    <span data-wiki="error">occultism</span> from various parent
    organizations, in part due to the trauma experienced by younger players of
    the game, a controversy intensified when, later in the series, Psycho
    Mantis's ability to change channels on the player's television monitor is
    revealed.

  <p>
    <sup>2</sup>A second technique for defeating The End in this manner was
    recently discovered involving the manipulation of the in-game console clock.

    <sup>3</sup>In perhaps its most notorious scene, the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>'s central protagonist spends upwards
    of seven
    solitary minutes <span data-wiki="error">climbing a metal ladder</span> following the defeat of The End to the
    soundtrack of <span data-wiki="enochian">enochian</span> <span data-wiki="light-singing">
