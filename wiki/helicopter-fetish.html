  <strong>Helicopter Fetish [AKA 'Copter Fetish]</strong> 
  <br />
  A term referring to the collective fascination and sexualization of helicopters throughout the 1980's and early 1990's<sup>1</sup> in Western culture. The phenomenon is commonly thought to have crested in a notorious television interview 1997 with the action star Tom Cruise<sup><strong><span data-wiki="tom-copter-fetish">Î©</span></strong></sup> - a rambling, often incoherent three-minute colloquy in which the actor says the word helicopter seventeen times and cries like a young boy. Oft-cited examples of 'copter fetishism include the television shows <em></em>Airwolf, Airwolf (Redux), and The A-Team, the films Predator, Blue Thunder2,  and Under Seige. Popular music was no stranger to the 'copter fetish craze - hair metal band Def Leppard featured an oft-bypassed cold open of the band arriving at the studio via 'copter in their hit Love Bites, DJ Total Freedom featured 'copter recordings in their live sets, and even the experimental serialist composer Stockhausen got in the mix, composing the Helikopter- Streichquartett3 as part of his epic seven-day-opera Licht.
