  <strong>Helicopter Fetish [AKA 'Copter Fetish]</strong> 
  <br />
  A term referring to the collective fascination and sexualization of helicopters throughout the 1980's and early 1990's<sup>1</sup> in Western culture. The phenomenon is commonly thought to have crested in a notorious television interview 1997 with the action star Tom Cruise<sup><strong><span data-wiki="tom-copter-fetish">Ω</span></strong></sup> - a rambling, often incoherent three-minute colloquy in which the actor says the word helicopter seventeen times and cries like a young boy. Oft-cited examples of 'copter fetishism include the television shows <em><span data-wiki="jan-michael-vincent">Airwolf</span></em>, <em><a href="../octagon-of-dex/">Airwolf (Redux)</a></em>, and <em>The A-Team</em>, the films <em><span data-wiki="arnold-schwarzenegger">Predator</span></em>, <em>Blue Thunder</em><sup>2</sup>,  and <em><span data-wiki="steven-seagal">Under Seige</span></em>. Popular music was no stranger to the 'copter fetish craze - hair metal band <span data-wiki="hysteria">Def Leppard</span> featured an oft-bypassed cold open of the band arriving at the studio via 'copter in their hit <em><a href="../hyperbolic-time-chamber/love-bytes.html">Love Bites</a></em>, DJ Total Freedom featured 'copter recordings in their live sets, and even the experimental serialist composer Stockhausen got in the mix, composing the <span data-wiki="error">Helikopter-Streichquartett</span><sup>3</sup><!--links to video in neon babylon--> as part of his epic seven-day-opera <em><span data-wiki="error">Licht</span></em>.<!--link to stockhausen wiki-->

  Analysis as to the origins and nature of 'copter fetishism vary, though some media theorists trace its roots back to the prominent role of helicopters in the development of early computer graphix, <span data-wiki="ai">artificial intelligence</span>, and early virtual reality devices. The efforts of <span data-wiki="error">Bell Helicopter</span>, a division of <span data-wiki="error">Ma Bell</span>, to equip their military-grade 'copters with night vision, missile tracking systems, and were integral to the development of core technology on all three fronts, leading later to early <span data-wiki="error">IBM</span> graphix<sup>4</sup> cards, <span data-wiki="deep-blue">Deep Blue</span>, and the <span data-wiki="sword-of-damocles">Sword of Damocles</span><strong><sup><a href="../hyperbolic-time-chamber/white-cube-o-death.html">Ω</a></sup></strong>. The personification of vehicular robots throughout the early 1980's, most notably in the <span data-wiki="transformers">Transformers</span> franchise, is also thought to have played a role.
