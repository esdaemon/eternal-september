  <br />
  Concept album by Queensr√øche, a band associated with both progressive metal
  and <span data-wiki="hair-metal">hair metal</span>, despite their professed
  aversion to the latter. <em>Operation: Mindcrime</em>'s narrative revolves
  around the central protagonist Nikki, a
  <span data-wiki="narcotics">narcotics </span>addict who descends gradually
  into a mode of full depersonalization via a permanent
  <span data-wiki="schizophrenia">schizophrenic break</span> and the full
  <span data-wiki="bicameralism">re-bicamerilization</span> of his mind. The
  album concludes with the hospitalized Nikki staring at his own face in the
  mirror, unable to recognize his own visage.
