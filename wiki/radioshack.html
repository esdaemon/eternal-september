  <strong>Radioshack [related: Tandy Corporation]</strong> <br />
  Worldwide electronics retailer started in 1921 by the brothers Theodore and Milton Deuschmann to service the emerging
  ham radio field. After filing for bankruptcy in the mid 1960's it was purchased for the paltry sum of $300,000 by
  Charles D. Tandy of the Tandy Corporation. In the 1980's, Tandy refocused the company in two areas: 1) cheap
  electronics including semi-functional robots, disposable remote control vehicles, and strange internationally sourced
  (and often outdated) cables, and 2) home telephones. With the government-led break-up of

  became highly profitable and was, for a time, both the largest dealer of telephones in the United States and the
  primary supplier of components used for phone hacking (or, as it is colloquially known, <span

  of its subsidiary <span data-wiki="memorex">Memorex</span> and the ill-advised purchase of the famously unprofitable
  Computer City in the 1990's,
  RadioShack's value again plummeted, despite experiencing a brief "<span data-wiki="error">pink twilight</span>" as a

  materials. As of 2012, RadioShack carried an "F" customer service rating with the Better Business Bureau, and was
  named by the Temkin Group, an independent research firm, as providing the worst customer service of any national
  retailer for six consecutive years. In its reports, Temkin cited many issues, including (but not limited to): severely
  undertrained and sometimes pre-pubescent employees, shell (gutted and non-functional) products, literally abandoned
  (though still partially stocked) locations in semi-operational suburban malls, and off-brand, universally
  non-compatible discount home computers with RAM rates easily surpassed by modern graphix calculators.
