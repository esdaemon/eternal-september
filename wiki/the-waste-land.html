  <strong><em>The Waste Land</em> aka <em>La Terre des Dechets</em> [related: T.S. Eliot, Boston Brahmin]</strong> 
  <br />
  Epic poem published in 1922 by Boston Brahmin<sup>1</sup> Thomas Stearns Eliot OM<sup>2</sup>. T.S. Eliot, as he was professionally known, composed the poem in 1922 to fulfill a $150 commission from the transcendentalist publication <em>The Dial</em> while on leave of absence from his job as a teller at Lloyd's Bank<sup>3</sup>. With its sudden changes of tense, perspective, and time period, <em>The Waste Land</em> was thought to be impenetrable upon its release. The density of its reference points alone was completely unprecedented. Ideas from <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhism</span>, <span data-wiki="error">Greek Mythology</span>, the Hindu <span data-wiki="error">Upanishads</span>, the poem's of <span data-wiki="baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</span>, the <span data-wiki="apocrypha">apocrypha</span> of <span data-wiki="error">Saint Augustine of Hippo</span>, and, prominently, the <span data-wiki="error">Tarot of Marseilles</span>, commingle throughout the poem in a stew of charded narratives and layered imagery. Through the use of digitized lexicography, the poem is now commonly thought of as a metaphorical <span data-wiki="codex">codex</span> for Eliot's tumultuous marriage<sup>4</sup> to Vivienne Haigh-Wood. A vivacious and passionate woman, Haigh-Wood was often represented as a <span data-wiki="incubus">succubus</span> or nymph in Eliot's work, lending credence to the rumors that he was a closeted homosexual. Although <em>The Waste Land</em> is now regarded in most academic circles as canon, the poem was referenced in the <em><span data-wiki="gravitys-rainbow">Gravity's Rainbow</span></em> Pulitzer hearings as an example of nonsensical pseudo-literature.

  <p><sup>1</sup>Term for Boston's W.A.S.P. (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant) [disambiguation: <span data-wiki="hair-metal">Hair Metal</span>] upper class coined by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. in 1860. The term "Brahmin" is taken from the Hindu caste system, meaning <em>priestly</em>. Oddly, the Boston Brahmins supported the Confederacy in the American  Civil War of 1861.</p>
  <p><sup>2</sup>Eliot renounced his American citizenship and permanently emigrated to England in 1927 at the age of 39, an act for which he was awarded the Order of Merit by the British government. </p>
  <p><sup>3</sup>The documented reason for Eliot's leave was "nervous breakdown". Eliot was rumored to have feigned increasingly erratic behavior in the weeks leading up to his request.  </p>
  <p><sup>4</sup>Haigh-Wood was committed to an asylum against her will from 1933 to 1947, the year of her passing - a span of time in which her husband never visited.</p>
