  <strong>Crystal Pepsi [related: PepsiCo, Tab Clear]</strong> 
  <br />
  Short-lived clear cola drink released by PepsiCo at the height of the <span data-wiki="error">cola wars</span>. Circulated between 1992 and 1994, Crystal Pepsi marked an effort by its parent company to capitalize on new marketshare created by consumer interest in "health-adjacent" products<sup>1</sup> and New Age branding<sup>3</sup>. The product experienced modest success in the months following its unveiling, garnering over 1% of the "refreshment beverage" market<sup>5</sup>. Approximately nine months after Crystal Pepsi's debut, the Coca-Cola launched Tab Clear, a low-quality <span data-wiki="saccharin">saccharine</span>-sweetened beverage of similar appearance. Tab Clear's off-puttingly medicinal taste, syrupy consistency, and general air of artificiality proved repellent to consumers - so much so, that Crystal Pepsi, along with other "tighty white" products, experienced an almost immediate decline in sales. In 1995, it was revealed that Coca-Cola had chosen to release one of the lowest scoring of Tab Clear's perspective formulas, leading to rumours that it was a "kamikaze" job - a deliberate effort to undermine not only the success of Crystal Pepsi but the commercial New Age movement more broadly. Ironically, the first clear cola product was released by Coca-Cola itself in the mid-1950's: "white coke" - a secret vodka-containing one-off released in partnership with the Soviet Union.

    <sup>1</sup>Reportedly instigated by the relaunch of Ivory soap with the slogan "99 & 44/100 percent pure"<sup>2</sup>.<br/>
    <sup>2</sup>The industry's fixation on clear and/or white products, dubbed "tighty whiteness", was based around the public's tendency to equate purity and quality with an absence of color<sup>3,4</sup>. <br/>
    <sup>3</sup>Unsurpringly, media theorists retroactively pointed towards "tighty whiteness" as an example of widespread implicit racism.<br/>
    <sup>4</sup>A concept not limited to the free market - throughout the 1990's, impure cocaine was often treated with (often poisonous) chemicals to bleach its hue. <br/>
    <sup>5</sup>Roughly equivalent to a billion dollars.
