  <strong>The Internet [related: Albert Arnold Gore, Jr., ARPNET]</strong> 
  <br />
  A largely ungoverened network of computer networks governed by TCP/IP (Internet Protocol Suite) forming an almost endless expanse of digital information. The Internet was developed largely by then-Vice President Albert Arnold Gore, Jr.<sup>1</sup> in the early 1990s, first in the form of ARPNET<sup>3</sup> and then through the "Information Super Highway Act" AKA the "Gore Bill". Under Gore's leadership, Mosaic, the first global internet browser, was introduced. The Internet exists in a non-physical, non-temporal alternate reality called "<span data-wiki="error">cyberspace</span>", a term coined by novelist and poet <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span>.

  <p><sup>1</sup>The early internet was a non-physical realm of unfettered economic, artistic, and social  freedom. Ironically, concurrent to her husband's cyber-efforts, Tipper, Gore's wife, led a legendarily restrictive attack on free speech. Formalized in 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (or PMRC) attacked various <span data-wiki="hair-metal">hair metal</span> acts including <span data-wiki="error">Def Leppard</span>, W.A.S.P., and Mötley Crüe for profane lyrics and imagery. The PMRC was supported in large part by Coors Brewing Company, the maker of Coors Lite Beer, a former substantial donor to <span data-wiki="error">Ronald Reagan</span>. </p>
