  <strong>Division Bell<sup>1</sup> [related: "The Bell", Carillon]</strong>
  <br />
  Alternate interpretation of the <span data-wiki="error">Exile from Paradise/Fall from Grace</span> myth based on the idea that the emergence of <span data-wiki="linguistics">language</span> (aka collective conceptualisation aka semantical systems) led to an artificial and impure fracturing of reality AKA <span data-wiki="dharma">The Emptiness</span>. This errant "division" of what in fact is fluid and whole (reality) led humanity to engage in increasingly greater and greater degrees of misguided, self-sabotaging behavior, including the development of sentient <span data-wiki="ai">A.I.</span>. In this way, division bell symbology can be thought of as a reframing of the biblical <span data-wiki="error">Exile from Paradise</span> myth from a fundamentally <span data-wiki="dharma">Buddhist</span> viewpoint. From this perspective, the prominence of bell ringing in various theological culture functions as a call to awakening<sup>2</sup>, a return to a more fundamental, language-less state - thus symbolizing an rousing from the world of mental constructs and signaling potential freedom from the gradual self-generated enfolding of collective human reality into a digitized meta-space as depicted in <span data-wiki="william-gibson">William Gibson</span>'s 1984 hard science fiction novel <em><span data-wiki="william-gibson">Neuromancer</span></em>. Following the time of Christ, throughout Europe, a carillon system of multiple bells housed in a raised structure at the center of town [i.e. the Belfry of <span data-wiki="bruges">Bruges</span>] is used to signal a call to attention, whether for worship or in awareness of a dawning threat - a tradition seen in overlapping variation throughout cultures featuring a mythical "fall from grace".
