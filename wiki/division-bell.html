  <strong>Division Bell<sup>1</sup> [related: "The Bell", Carillon,
    <em>Diaspora</em>]</strong>
  <br />
  Alternate interpretation of the
  <!-- tbd where links in christian stuff -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Garden of Eden/Fall of Man</span>
  <span data-wiki="error">Christian</span> myth based on the idea that the
  emergence of language (aka collective
  conceptualisation aka semantical systems) led to an artificial and impure
  fracturing of reality. This errant "division" of what in fact is fluid and
  whole (reality) led humanity to engage in increasingly greater and greater
  degrees of misguided, self-sabotaging behavior. In this way, division bell
  symbology can be thought of as a reframing of the Christian
  exile-from-paradise myth from a fundamentally
  <!-- links to buddhism -->
  <span data-wiki="error">Buddhist</span> viewpoint. From this perspective, the
  prominence of <span data-wiki="division-bell">bell ringing</span> in various
  theological culture functions as a call to awakening, a return to a more
  fundamental, language-less state - thus symbolizing an awakening from the
  world of mental constructs and signaling potential freedom from the gradual
  self-generated enfolding of collective human reality into a digitized
  meta-space as depicted in George Egan's 1997 hard science fiction novel
  <em>Diaspora</em>. Following the time of Christ, throughout Europe, a carillon
  system of multiple bells housed in a raised structure at the center of town
  [i.e. the Belfry of <span data-wiki="bruges">Bruges</span>] is used to signal
  a call to attention, whether for worship or in awareness of a dawning threat -
  a tradition seen in overlapping variation throughout cultures featuring a
  mythical "fall from grace".
