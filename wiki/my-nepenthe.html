  <strong><em>My Nepenthe</em> [1989]</strong> 
  <br />
  An ill-conceived and poorly reviewed television pilot named for an <span data-wiki="error">ancient and mysterious Greek narcotic</span>. The show was created and directed by <span data-wiki="steven-bochco">Steven Bochco</span>, a fly by night scholar of the antiquities. Canceled after just one airing, the show's convoluted plot involved an intricate web of time travel, sexual promiscuity, and <span data-wiki="error">cocaine</span> trafficking. The show's opening credit sequence, scored by experimental progressive rock band <span data-wiki="error">Octagon of Dex</span>, was notable for the use of anachronistic and geographically inaccurate stock footage.
