  <br />
  Experimental ensemble of fluid membership featuring a mixed instrumentation of classical string instruments, analog and early digital electronics, electric guitars, saxophone, and pop-oriented vocals. Although Electric Snow Dream took care to shroud itself in secrecy, the project was reportedly masterminded by composer/vocalist Deb Blanchard. The group's only commercial release was <em><a href="../electric-snow-dream/">Alive in the Electric Snow Dream</a></em>, a feverish suite of seven songs amassing a meager 12 minutes of runtime. The longform piece <span data-wiki="error">Death in Carthage</span><!--links to death in carthage vid on esd isaac is making-->, an aggressively feminist retelling of the Dido and Aenas <span data-wiki="error">Greek myth</span> featuring reworked elements of Henry Purcell's famed opera is also commonly attributed to the group<sup>1</sup>.
