  <strong><em>The Spaceships of Ezekiel</em> (historical novel) [disambiguation: Spaceships of Ezekiel (experimental jazz ensemble)]</strong>
  <br />
  Originally published in German under the title
  <em>Da tat sich der Himmel auf</em>, <em>The Spaceships of Ezekiel </em>is a
  1974 book by Josef F. Blumrich who was, at the time of publication, NASA's
  Chief of Systems Development at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The project
  originated out of Blumrich's effort to discredit prominent ufologist Erich von
  Däniken's claim that the bible outlined several extraterrestrial encounters.
  However, upon extensive study of Däniken's materials and various

  <span data-wiki="error">Gnostic</span> texts, Blumrich in fact became
  convinced that the biblical character Ezekiel had in fact made contact with an
  ancient alien spacecraft<sup>1</sup>. As part of the book, Blumrich outlined
  various aspects of the technology described by Ezekiel, including numerous
  diagrams of the Omni Wheel, a wheel that not only spins backwards and forwards
  but also sideways. Blumrich subsequently patented the Omni Wheel and it now
  features in various land rovers designs for remote lunar and Martian
  exploration.

    <sup>1</sup>In the late 1890s Burrell Cannon, a Baptist minister,
    multi-linguist, and amateur woodworker in Texarkana, Texas, used the same
    source material analyzed by Blumrich to design and build the Ezekiel
    Airship, a gasoline-powered paddle wheel contraption that may in fact have
    been humanity's first successful flying machine. Reportedly, all those who
    were present at the Ezekiel Airship's first flight in 1901 were sworn to
    secrecy, and the plans and blueprints were incinerated. The Airship itself
    is documented to have been destroyed in a storm on the way to the 1904
    World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.
