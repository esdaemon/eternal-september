  Japanese technology company originally founded in 1889 by the entrepreneur
  Fusajiro Yamauchi for the production and dissemination of
  <em>Hanafuda</em> (flower cards), despite the banning of such card sets by the
  Japanese government in 1816 due to their prevalence in black market and
  underground gambling rings. In 1959 Nintendo entered into an agreement with
  Walt Disney to incorporate its trademarked characters into limited edition
  card sets, an initiative that proved overly reliant on the highly volatile
  children's market, leading to huge losses<sup>1</sup> and a subsequent turn to
  machine-based technological development and production resulting in the
  production of Japan's first electronic toy in the early 1970's. With over a
  million units sold upon its release, the Nintendo Beam Gun, an photo-realistic
  optoelectric pistol. Additional success followed with the release of the Ultra
  Hand, the Ultra Machine, and, mostly notably, the Love Tester<sup>2</sup>. In
  1978, Nintendo released the Othello-influenced Color TV-Game, its first video
  game. The staggering success of the Color TV-Game and the subsequent rapid
  development of microprocessing technology led to the heralded release of the
  Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. Building on the success of
  <em>Donkey Kong </em>(the first video game to including jumping), Nintendo
  built an extensive gaming empire, successfully overwhelming competitive
  companies such as Sega, ColecoVision, and Atari, while boosting both licensed
  game developers like <span data-wiki="konami">Konami</span>, Capcom, and Tecmo
  and third party electronic suppliers like Ricoh<sup>3</sup>. Analysts and
  metaphysicists have pointed to the use of newly created and expertly crafted
  music on original NES titles under the direction of composer Koji Kondo as
  significantly increasing the "palpability" of the video gaming world from that
  point forward via the incorporation of emotion and poignance into standard
  gameplay. The "palpability factor" has been identified as a core component of
  the development of effective simulacra and integral to the functionality of

    <sup>1 </sup>These losses were partially offset by the production of
    off-label, separately disseminated "adult" card sets focusing largely on
    geisha-fetishization and "Lolicon" [citation needed].

    <sup>2</sup>A device that measured the love between two individuals via
    spherical meta sensors utilizing rudimentary electronic circuitry (in fact,
    the first use of actual circuitry in any Nintendo product). When operated
    properly, the Love Tester displays a "love score" [scaled 1-100]. The exact
    nature of the machine's functionality was kept secret from the public,
    leading to accusations of occultism and to reports of a slight uptick in
    "empty nest" divorce throughout the country due to the tendency for older
    participates to generate lower "love scores".

    <sup>3</sup>Nintendo's primary supplier of superconductors. Founded on
    February 6, 1936 by the government of Japan to conduct technological
    research and development originally under the moniker Institute of Physical
    and Chemical Research. Ricoh Innovations, Ricoh's US subsidiary operates out
    of Silicon Valley and specializes in cloud computing. On July 19, 2016, the
    company admitted to stealing around 12 million Indian Rupee, resulting in
    mass resignation and subsequent litigation of its Indian branch.
