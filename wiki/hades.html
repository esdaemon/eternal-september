  <br />
  The Greek Underworld AKA Land of the Dead. Positioned at the "end of the ocean", Hades is riddled with rivers, incl. Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Oceanus. The Kingdom of Death's entrance is guarded by many literal and mythological beasts including [but not limited to] Centaurs and Chima. Souls entering Hades were beseeched to provide the psychopomp Charon with an <span data-wiki="obolus">Obolus</span> to ensure safe passage. At the deepest depths of Hades lies Tartarus, a pitch black abyss of nothingness reserved for the gravest transgressors of honor and duty. In contrast, <span data-wiki="asphodel-meadows">Asphodel Meadows</span> was a land of milquetoast indifference for the Scranton-used-car-salesmen types. A bastion of masochism, the <span data-wiki="error">Mourning Fields</span> were reserved for those who drown in the deep, dark pool of unrequited love, ex. <span data-wiki="error">Dido</span> and Phaedra. The realm of Hades - named after its eponymous Greek God, an equivalent figure to <span data-wiki="error">Osiris</span> in Egyptian culture - is considered separate from <span data-wiki="error">Elysium</span>. Various living or semi-living peoples reportedly resided in Hades' depths, funneling its cosmic darkness into groundbreaking magick and/or metallurgical practices. See: Rhodian Dactyls.
