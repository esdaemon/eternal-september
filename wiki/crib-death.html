  <strong>Crib Death</strong> <br />
  Commonly known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or SIDS, Crib Death is the
  sudden and unexplained - even after thorough autopsy - death of a child less
  than one year old. Although rates of SIDS-related quietus vary widely
  throughout the world, it is currently the third leading cause of death among
  American infants. Sociologists fear a large number of Crib Death cases are in
  fact unreported instances of child abuse in the form of
  suffocation-by-soft-pillow and/or excessive second hand tobacco smoke.
