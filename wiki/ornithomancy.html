  <strong>Ornithomancy AKA Augury [related: Swans/Cygnets, Crows, Magpie, Thrush]</strong> <br />
  The study and shamanic reading of bird behaviors and flock patterns. Throughout Greek and Roman mythology, birds travel freely between the world of the living and the dead, making them ideal arbiters of the Threshold. As the only dinosaurs still in existence, birds have the distinction of surviving numerous mass extinctions and many species have, over time, developed extremely sophisticated modes of communication and culture, i.e., they are the only animals other than humans to create art [see: <span data-wiki="bowerbirds">Bowerbirds</span>]. Although the conglomerate catalog of recognized ornithological omens is prohibitively vast, common representations include the following:
