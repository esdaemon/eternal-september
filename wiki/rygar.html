    <em>Warrior of Argus</em>]</strong>
  <br />
  Released by Tecmo for both the <span data-wiki="nes">NES</span> and the Atari
  Lynx. Although generally considered to be outside the
  <span data-wiki="konami">Konami</span>/Capcom EHSPF, it has been argued that
  <em>Rygar</em> contains many commonalities in terms of gameplay, mythology,
  non-linear gameplay, and life/death portal functionality. Music by
